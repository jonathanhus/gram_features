Many root words can function in more than one class and may be found in more than one place. A number of words listed as nouns and verbs might not be considered to be such in English. However, in Ilokano they function semanti­ cally as such. In the pronoun tables, the number 1 refers to first person, or speaker. First person plural is the exclusive pronoun. It does not include the person spoken to. The number 2 refers to the second person, or person spoken to. When singular, the numbers 1 and 2 refer to the dual person, i.e., the speaker and one hearer. When plural, the numbers 1 and 2 refer to the first person inclusive pronoun. It refers not only to the speaker (and his group) but to the hearers.

This little sentence modifier is very com­ mon. It has two forms, -en occurs after a consonant, and -n occurs after a vowel.

In other words, the actor of the action is the subject of the sentence. However, when a verb has a patient (sometimes called an object) which is a pronoun, a personal noun or a definite noun phrase (that is, one which can be translated with the, but not a), Ilokano always makes the patient the subject of the sentence, e.g.,\n\nPredicate Agent\nKayat''ko i i I\nKayadko Kayatjko\n\nSubject ni Juan.\nisiina. ti libro.\n\nI like John. (John is liked by me.) I like him. I like the book.\n\nVerbs, like kayat, which indicate that the subject of the sentence is not the Actor but is the patient, are called\n\n66\n\n\fpatient-focus verbs. Notice the word order, predicate first, agent second, subject (patient) third. Notice also that the agent pronouns are the same set that is used for possessor. This is why the KO set is sometimes called genitive, be­ cause it is used for agents as well as possessors.\n\nIX. EXERCISES\n\nA. Add a locative word or determiner to the following sentences.\n\n1.

Kayatna a kitaek ni Maria.\n\nHe wants me to see Maria.\n\nB. Culture\nChaperoning is still commonly practiced in the Philippines, especially in rural areas, and in the city when the family has rural associations. It is customary to have a younger sibling or cousin go along with an elder sister when she is invited out by someone of the opposite sex.\n\n95",

These morphological treatments are distinct from those used on verbs, which can include specific focus markers like '-an' and '-en' for patient-focus verbs, or the insertion of '-um-' for actor-focus verbs. Therefore, adnominal property words are accompanied by morphological elements that are not obligatory with attributive verbs, indicating a different treatment.",

It forms another noun.\nb. ag- is one of the many prefixes that form verbs. It can be attached to roots that are verb-like, such as takder (stand) to form agtakder (to stand up), Agtakderka! (Stand up!). It can also be attached to many noun-like roots, such as sapdtos (shoes), to form agsapdtos (to wear shoes), Agsapdtoska! (Put shoes on!).\nOther verb-forming prefixes are mang- and ma-.\nThe differences between these prefixes is subtle and for the time being it is better to learn which prefix most commonly occurs with which roots.\nSome verbs commonly use -um- rather than ag-t mang-, or ma-, such as gumdtang (to buy), and uminom (to drink). Notice that -um- is inserted into a word that begins with a consonant. It always immedi­ ately precedes the first vowel. For example:\n\n17\n\n\fg-um-dtang b-um-ulod d-um-dwat um-inom um-isem um-utang\n\nto buy to borrow to ask for to drink to smile to owe",

Ilokano has three pronouns that are not distinguished in English. These will be explained here using the SIAK set, but the AK set and the KO set also contain pronouns with the same meanings.\n\na. English uses you whether you are speaking to one person or to more than one. In Ilokano sika (you) is restricted to one person; dakayo (you) is nor­ mally used for plural, but can be used for singular if the speaker is being polite.\n\nsika\n\nyou (singular)\n\ndakayo\n\nyou (plural), or you (singular, polite)\n\nb. In English, the pronoun we can be used if the speaker is talking about himself and his friends\n\n50\n\n\fand not including the person he is speaking to. Or it may include the hearer. In ɪlokano, three differ­ ent pronouns are used to mean we.\ndata we two. This pronoun is used if the speaker includes only one other person with him.\ndatayo we all. This pronoun is used if the speaker includes the person, or persons who are listening to him.\ndakami we not you. This pronoun is used if the speaker excludes the person or persons who are listening to him.\n\n3. Negative Questions And Their Responses. A negative question is formed just like a negative statement, using saan, but with different intonation:\n\na. Saanka nga Amerikano. You are not an American.\n\nb. Saanka nga Amerikdno? Are you not an American?",

The data indicates that there are specific affixes used to mark whether an action is completed (perfective) or not completed (imperfective). For example, the completed actions use prefixes like 'nag-', 'sim-', 'bim-', and 'in-', while the noncompleted forms use prefixes like 'ag-', 'sum-', 'bum-', 'um-', etc. This means that either the perfective or imperfective aspect is overtly marked, satisfying the criteria for a code 1.",

There are different kinds of reduplication and each kind has several meanings. The repetition of the first consonant (C), first vowel (V), and second consonant (C), is called CVC-reduplication:\nlaglagto lablaba luglugan\nCVC-reduplication also covers words with more than one initial consonant like lrabdhot and words which start with a vowel like inom:\ntrabtrabaho in-inom ay-aywan ap-apura\nWhen a word does not contain a middle consonant, like, ddit (sew) only CV- is repeated but the vowel is made long, ddddit.\nThere are two meanings for CVC- reduplication that we will consider here; these are ‘continuative’ and ‘cus­ tomary*.\n\n78\n\n\fa. If an action is actually going on at the time of speaking, it is a continuative action. In English, we usually translate it with is and -ing, e.g.,\n\nagtrabtrabaho aglaglagto agdadait\n\nis working is jumping is sewing\n\nb. If an action is customary and one that is usually per­ formed, but is not necessarily being performed at the time of speaking, e.g.,\n\nAgtrabtrabdho ni Juan. John works. He has a job.\n1 Auxiliary i Main Verb\n\nmapan/in- i Verb\n\numay\n\ni\n\n1__________\n\nThere are two auxiliary verbs denoting direction in Ilo-\n\nkano, one meaning motion away from the speaker, mapan\n\n(go); the other, motion toward the speaker, umay (come).",

The repetition of the first consonant (C), first vowel (V), and second consonant (C), is called CVC-reduplication:\nlaglagto lablaba luglugan\nCVC-reduplication also covers words with more than one initial consonant like lrabdhot and words which start with a vowel like inom:\ntrabtrabaho in-inom ay-aywan ap-apura\nWhen a word does not contain a middle consonant, like, ddit (sew) only CV- is repeated but the vowel is made long, ddddit.\nThere are two meanings for CVC- reduplication that we will consider here; these are ‘continuative’ and ‘cus­ tomary*.\n\n78\n\n\fa. If an action is actually going on at the time of speaking, it is a continuative action. In English, we usually translate it with is and -ing, e.g.,\n\nagtrabtrabaho aglaglagto agdadait\n\nis working is jumping is sewing\n\nb. If an action is customary and one that is usually per­ formed, but is not necessarily being performed at the time of speaking, e.g.,\n\nAgtrabtrabdho ni Juan. John works. He has a job.\n1 Auxiliary i Main Verb\n\nmapan/in- i Verb\n\numay\n\ni\n\n1__________\n\nThere are two auxiliary verbs denoting direction in Ilo-\n\nkano, one meaning motion away from the speaker, mapan\n\n(go); the other, motion toward the speaker, umay (come).",

There are different kinds of reduplication and each kind has several meanings. The repetition of the first consonant (C), first vowel (V), and second consonant (C), is called CVC-reduplication:\nlaglagto lablaba luglugan\nCVC-reduplication also covers words with more than one initial consonant like lrabdhot and words which start with a vowel like inom:\ntrabtrabaho in-inom ay-aywan ap-apura\nWhen a word does not contain a middle consonant, like, ddit (sew) only CV- is repeated but the vowel is made long, ddddit.\nThere are two meanings for CVC- reduplication that we will consider here; these are ‘continuative’ and ‘cus­ tomary*.\n\n78\n\n\fa. If an action is actually going on at the time of speaking, it is a continuative action. In English, we usually translate it with is and -ing, e.g.,\n\nagtrabtrabaho aglaglagto agdadait\n\nis working is jumping is sewing\n\nb.

In Lesson Five we noticed that cer­ tain adverb-like words, such as pasaray, masansan, and kandyon, can be joined to a verb with a linker. These form a compound predicate. A number of other words can also\n\n94\n\n\fbe linked to a verb to form a compound predicate. Two such words are mabalin (can) and masdpol (necessary):\n\na. Mabalin a mapanka.\n\nYou can go.\n\nb. Masapol a mapanka.\n\nYou must go.\n\nOne other commonly occurring compound predicate con­ tains the patient-focus verb kayat with a KO set pronoun or a genitive noun phrase:\n\nc. Kayatna a mapanka.\n\nHe wants you to go-\n\nd. Kayat ni Juan a mapanka.\n\nJuan wants you to go-\n\nNotice that in examples c. and d. the agent of kayat (-na, ni Juan) and the subject of the sentence (-ka) must refer to different people. If they were the same (as in He wants to go), it would be necessary to use an embedded sentence in the subject as described above in section three of these notes:\n\ne. Kayatna ti mapan.\n\nHe wants to go.\n\nA patient-focus verb can also occur in a compound predi­ cate with kayat and a KO set pronoun or a genitive noun phrase, but the subject of the sentence must refer to another person:\n\nf. Kayatna a kitaen ni Maria.\n\nHe wants to see Maria.\n\nNotice that the agent of kayat and kitaen may be the same, as in f. above, or it may be different:\n\ng. Kayatna a kitaek ni Maria.\n\nHe wants me to see Maria.\n\nB. Culture\nChaperoning is still commonly practiced in the Philippines, especially in rural areas, and in the city when the family has rural associations. It is customary to have a younger sibling or cousin go along with an elder sister when she is invited out by someone of the opposite sex.\n\n95",

Plurals Of Nouns. We mentioned earlier (Lesson Three) that ti dso could mean the dog or the dogs, but that dagiti dso could only mean the dogs. Notice that in these exam­ ples, the word for dog did not change whether it was singu­ lar or plural. It is possible, however, to make a plural form of common nouns like aso, by adding a CVC- prefix. The different forms of CVC- are the same as were discussed earlier for comparative adjectives, i.e., VC- if the word starts with a vowel, and CV- if there is no middle conso­ nant:\n\nkaykayo tugtugaw as-aso al-alɪngo wdwdig\n\ntrees chairs dogs wild pigs streams\n\nThere is a set of nouns referring to human beings that require the plural form to be used if they are in fact plural. These nouns have a different way of forming the plural. They double the consonant that follows the first vowel of the word. Some also require the reduplication of the first CV- of the word. Compare the plural words in the follow­ ing list.\n\nsingular plural\n\ngrandchild father mother child offspring young man young woman old man old woman male female spouse person\n\napðko ama ina ubing anak baro balasang lakay baket lalaki babcii asawa tdo\n\nappðko amma inna ubbing annak babbaro babbaldsang lallakay babbaket lallaki babbdi assawa tattdo\n\n187\n\n\f3. Reason Sentence. A reason sentence frequently is used as a response to an dpay (why) question. The word ngamin (that’s why) is placed after the first main word of the rea­ son sentence:\n\nQuestion: Apay a nagsakitka? How come you got sick?\n\nAnswer:",

Although there are some sentences in which either form can be used, there are others in which only one of the negatives can be appropriately used. One of the main differences between saan and di is that saan acts like a verb in that it is necessary to have a linker between it and a following sentence which it negates:\n\nSaan nga agtrabtrabaho Ni Juan.\n\nJuan is not working.\n\nSaan nga dso dayta.\n\nThat is not a dog.\n\nSaan a nabsog ni Carmen. Carmen is not full.\n\nOn the other hand di is an auxiliary, like mapan and umay because it does not need a linker between itself and a following verb:\n\nDi nagsao ti lakay.\n\nThe old man did not speak.",

Although there are some sentences in which either form can be used, there are others in which only one of the negatives can be appropriately used. One of the main differences between saan and di is that saan acts like a verb in that it is necessary to have a linker between it and a following sentence which it negates:\n\nSaan nga agtrabtrabaho Ni Juan.\n\nJuan is not working.\n\nSaan nga dso dayta.\n\nThat is not a dog.\n\nSaan a nabsog ni Carmen. Carmen is not full.\n\nOn the other hand di is an auxiliary, like mapan and umay because it does not need a linker between itself and a following verb:\n\nDi nagsao ti lakay.\n\nThe old man did not speak.",

        "comment": "The data indicates that the negator 'awan' is used for existential and locational negation, but there is no clear information on nominal predication negation. However, the evidence suggests a difference in negation markers between non-verbal and verbal predications, as 'awan' is not typically used for verbal negation in Iloko.",

Kayatna a kitaek ni Maria.\n\nHe wants me to see Maria.\n\nB.

In Lesson Five we noticed that cer­ tain adverb-like words, such as pasaray, masansan, and kandyon, can be joined to a verb with a linker. These form a compound predicate. A number of other words can also\n\n94\n\n\fbe linked to a verb to form a compound predicate. Two such words are mabalin (can) and masdpol (necessary):\n\na. Mabalin a mapanka.\n\nYou can go.\n\nb. Masapol a mapanka.\n\nYou must go.\n\nOne other commonly occurring compound predicate con­ tains the patient-focus verb kayat with a KO set pronoun or a genitive noun phrase:\n\nc. Kayatna a mapanka.\n\nHe wants you to go-\n\nd. Kayat ni Juan a mapanka.\n\nJuan wants you to go-\n\nNotice that in examples c. and d. the agent of kayat (-na, ni Juan) and the subject of the sentence (-ka) must refer to different people. If they were the same (as in He wants to go), it would be necessary to use an embedded sentence in the subject as described above in section three of these notes:\n\ne. Kayatna ti mapan.\n\nHe wants to go.\n\nA patient-focus verb can also occur in a compound predi­ cate with kayat and a KO set pronoun or a genitive noun phrase, but the subject of the sentence must refer to another person:\n\nf. Kayatna a kitaen ni Maria.\n\nHe wants to see Maria.\n\nNotice that the agent of kayat and kitaen may be the same, as in f. above, or it may be different:\n\ng. Kayatna a kitaek ni Maria.\n\nHe wants me to see Maria.\n\nB. Culture\nChaperoning is still commonly practiced in the Philippines, especially in rural areas, and in the city when the family has rural associations. It is customary to have a younger sibling or cousin go along with an elder sister when she is invited out by someone of the opposite sex.\n\n95",

However, when a verb has a patient (sometimes called an object) which is a pronoun, a personal noun or a definite noun phrase (that is, one which can be translated with the, but not a), Ilokano always makes the patient the subject of the sentence, e.g.,\n\nPredicate Agent\nKayat''ko i i I\nKayadko Kayatjko\n\nSubject ni Juan.\nisiina. ti libro.\n\nI like John. (John is liked by me.) I like him. I like the book.\n\nVerbs, like kayat, which indicate that the subject of the sentence is not the Actor but is the patient, are called\n\n66\n\n\fpatient-focus verbs. Notice the word order, predicate first, agent second, subject (patient) third. Notice also that the agent pronouns are the same set that is used for possessor. This is why the KO set is sometimes called genitive, be­ cause it is used for agents as well as possessors.\n\nIX. EXERCISES\n\nA. Add a locative word or determiner to the following sentences.\n\n1. Saanka a mapan\n\nbalay?\n\nover there\n\n2. Gumatangtayo ti gasolina\n\nr Shell. here\n\n3. Sinno ti ɪlokano in\n\npamiliayo?\n\n4. Sinno ti kaeskuelaam in",

Grammar\n1.\n\nPredicate\nNoun Verb Adjective Other parts of speech\ntaga-ano taga-Kalihi agtrabtrabaho mapan\n\nSubject\n-AK pronoun\n-ka -ak -ka -ak\n\n16\n\n\fA single word in Ilokano can express a whole sentence. When the subject of a sentence is a pronoun it is joined on to the end of the predicate, e.g., Maestrd-ak (ɪ am a teach­ er) and Estudianteka (You are a student). (The third person singular pronoun isu or isuna are separate words, how­ ever.) The pronouns which are used to express the subject are the -AK set. The complete set of -AK pronouns is given in the glossary at the back of the text.\n\nnoun verb adjective\n\nprefix tagaagna-\n\nroot Kalihi trabaho imbag\n\nIn English we frequently build words using prefixes and suffixes, un- is a prefix on unknown, and unsure; -ing is a suffix on seeing and knowing, ɪlokano uses many prefixes and suffixes when building its nouns, verbs and adjectives.\na. /tfgtf-(person from) is a prefix which can be attached to any place name. It forms another noun.\nb. ag- is one of the many prefixes that form verbs. It can be attached to roots that are verb-like, such as takder (stand) to form agtakder (to stand up), Agtakderka! (Stand up!). It can also be attached to many noun-like roots, such as sapdtos (shoes), to form agsapdtos (to wear shoes), Agsapdtoska! (Put shoes on!).\nOther verb-forming prefixes are mang- and ma-.\nThe differences between these prefixes is subtle and for the time being it is better to learn which prefix most commonly occurs with which roots.\nSome verbs commonly use -um- rather than ag-t mang-, or ma-, such as gumdtang (to buy), and uminom (to drink). Notice that -um- is inserted into a word that begins with a consonant. It always immedi­ ately precedes the first vowel. For example:\n\n17\n\n\fg-um-dtang b-um-ulod d-um-dwat um-inom um-isem um-utang\n\nto buy to borrow to ask for to drink to smile to owe",

The same meanings occur when CVC- is used on patient­ focus verbs:\n\na. Dddaitenna ti badona. She is sewing her dress.\n\nb. Kandyon a basbasaenna dagiti suratmo. He is always reading your letters.\n\nA verb is continuative when the action is on-going, whether in the present or in the past, and customary when the action is done on a recurring basis.\n\nB. Culture When announcing one’s self as a visitor, it is not normal to knock on the door of an llokano home. It is usual to call, Adda tdo, Apo! Literally: There is a person, Sir! The response from within is usually Sumrekka (Come in) or Umulika (Come\n113\n\n\fup). In traditional Ilokano society, the latter would be most commonly used because houses are set on poles, and access to the house is up the house ladder called agdan.\n\nIX. EXERCISES\nA. Write the continuative forms of the following verbs. The underlined portion is the root word.\n\naglɪito aglaba\n\nʌglutluto 'ʃʊ] 1 '1\nu\n\nni Juan ita. Juan is cooking now.\nti ubing idiay banio. The child is washing clothes in the bathroom.\n\naginana\n\nU æ I’m resting.\n\nagadal\n\nkayo, ania? You (plural) are studying, aren’t you?\n\nmangala mangardmid",

Grammar\n\nI. To be specific about which particular thing is being re­ ferred to, a demonstrative can be used by itself (as in a. below) or with a following noun (as in b. below):\n\na. Basaem daytoy.\n\nRead this.\n\nb. Basaem daytoy libro. Read this book.\n\nA demonstrative is also used to distinguish between similar things. In order to do this a linker is placed between the demonstrative and the noun:\n\n92\n\n\fc. Basaem daytoy a libro. Read this book (not the other one).\nThe full set of demonstratives and their meanings is given in the Glossary.\n\n2. -EN VERBS, verbs which have an -en suffix are patient focus verbs, i.e., the subject of the sentence is the patient (or object) and not the one doing the action:\n\na. Buyaenta ti sine\n\nLet’s watch the movie.\n\nb. Alaenta ti priitas.\n\nLet’s get the fruit.",

In order to do this a linker is placed between the demonstrative and the noun:\n\n92\n\n\fc. Basaem daytoy a libro.

One of each pair will turn so that he cannot see the blackboard; his partner will face the blackboard.\n\n2. The teacher will place a series of different colored cards on the board, each marked with a price, the lowest price to the left, the highest to the right.\n\n3. The students who cannot see the blackboard will be given sets of colored cards, the same as those on the board, but not marked with prices.\n\n4. The goal is to arrange the cards in the same order as those on the board by asking one’s partner in ɪlokano whether a given color is more expensive than another, or whether a given color is cheaper than another. The partner may only respond with 'Mfcrt’or 'Saan’.\n\nB. You have just taken a world tour. Your roommate is planning a world tour next year. She asks you to compare the different places you have been to so she can plan how much time she should spend in each place.\n\nC. You and your partner are teachers. You are comparing your students.\n\nD. You and your partner are students. You are comparing your teachers.\n\nXI. WRITING PRACTICE Each student will think of a sentence containing a comparative adjective and write it on the board until a coherent dialog is created. For example: A: Daytoy ti gatdngem ta naluluom. B: Diak kayat. Naluluom dayta ngem basbassit.\nC: Basbassit daytoy ngem nasamsam-it.\nD: Nasamsam-it ngem nanginngɪna.\n(ken dadduma pay) (etc.)\n\n197",

Are you working?\nb. The other kind of question is called an Information Ques­ tion, because it seeks information, usually by using such words as What, Who, Where, When, and Why. In English this kind of question is sometimes called a Wh-Question. In ɪlokano, information questions have the question word in the predicate. The subject contains the thing being inquired about:\n\nwhat\n\nPredicate ania\n\nSubject i ti ।I common noun\n\nwho sinno\n\nti ।i common noun\n\nwhere sadinno Examples:\n\nti ।i place noun i\n\n1. Ania ti trabdhona? What is his work?\n\n2. Sinno ti maestr^yo? Who is your teacher?\n\n3. Sadinno ti papanam? Where are you going?\n\nSentences like 3 above are usually shortened by eliminating the first two words, so that a location question usually con­ sists simply of a location word:\n\nPapanam?\n\nLiterally: Place-of-your-going?\n\nPaggigianam? Literally: Place-of-your-living?\n\nQuestion words such as these are commonly used, so in the following section, we will examine the way they are con­ structed.\n\n5. Locative Gerunds. A gerund is a word which started life as a verb, but has been changed into a noun:\n\npapanan\n\nplace of going, destination\n\npaggɪgianan\n\nplace of living, residence\n\n19\n\n\fBoth of these words are based on verb roots, pan (go) and gian (stay), but after they have been prefixed and suffixed, they have become nouns. Because there are complexities in the analysis and description of these two common words, simpler forms will be used to illustrate the formation of locative ger­ unds.\n\npag- Verb -an\n\npag- trabahu -an\n\npag- adal\n\n-an\n\npag- digus\n\n-an\n\npag- gian\n\n-an",

A number of other words can also\n\n94\n\n\fbe linked to a verb to form a compound predicate. Two such words are mabalin (can) and masdpol (necessary):\n\na. Mabalin a mapanka.\n\nYou can go.\n\nb. Masapol a mapanka.\n\nYou must go.\n\nOne other commonly occurring compound predicate con­ tains the patient-focus verb kayat with a KO set pronoun or a genitive noun phrase:\n\nc. Kayatna a mapanka.\n\nHe wants you to go-\n\nd. Kayat ni Juan a mapanka.\n\nJuan wants you to go-\n\nNotice that in examples c. and d. the agent of kayat (-na, ni Juan) and the subject of the sentence (-ka) must refer to different people. If they were the same (as in He wants to go), it would be necessary to use an embedded sentence in the subject as described above in section three of these notes:\n\ne. Kayatna ti mapan.\n\nHe wants to go.\n\nA patient-focus verb can also occur in a compound predi­ cate with kayat and a KO set pronoun or a genitive noun phrase, but the subject of the sentence must refer to another person:\n\nf. Kayatna a kitaen ni Maria.\n\nHe wants to see Maria.\n\nNotice that the agent of kayat and kitaen may be the same, as in f. above, or it may be different:\n\ng. Kayatna a kitaek ni Maria.\n\nHe wants me to see Maria.\n\nB.

For example:\n\n17\n\n\fg-um-dtang b-um-ulod d-um-dwat um-inom um-isem um-utang\n\nto buy to borrow to ask for to drink to smile to owe",

When either -ko or -mo are the agent pronouns following an -en Verb, the pronoun is joined to the suffix, just like when they follow -an:\n\n- en 4- ko becomes -ek - en + mo becomes -em\n\n- an + ko becomes -ak - an + mo becomes -am\n\nCompare the following actor focus verbs with their patient focus counterparts.

These embedded sentences, however, do not contain a subject of their own, e.g., Ka­ yatmo ti agbiiya ti sine? (Do you want to watch a movie?) In this sentence, agbiiya ti sine (watch a movie) is an em­ bedded sentence that does not contain a subject.\n\n4. Future Tense. A sentence such as Agbiiyaak ti sine can have a future meaning as it is (I’ll watch a movie). How­ ever, it is possible to make it explicitly future by adding a future tense marker, either -to (if added to a word ending in a consonant) or -nto (if added to a word ending in a vowel):\n\nAgbiiyaakto ti sine.",

In Lesson Three we noted that many adjectives arc formed by prefixing na- to the root word:\n\nnasaydat nagaget naimbag\n\nfine industrious good\n\nThere are, however, many adjectives which do not have any affixes at all. Some of these begin with a, which is an old adjective-forming prefix which is no longer used as a prefix and just forms part of the root word:\n\nababa asideg\n\nshort near\n\n112\n\n\fadayo atiddog akdba akɪkid\netc.\n\nfar long wide narrow\n\nA number of adjectives are simply root words:\n\ndakkel bassit ddan baro\netc.\n\nbig small old new\n\nOther adjectives are formed with a ma- prefix:\n\nmabisin\n\nhungry\n\nmabain\n\nshy\n\nmabuteng\n\nafraid\n\nmasakit\n\nsick\n\n6. In Lesson Six, we learned about CVC-reduplication, and some of its meanings. We noted how with actor-focus verbs it gives either a. continuative or b. customary meaning. The same meanings occur when CVC- is used on patient­ focus verbs:\n\na. Dddaitenna ti badona. She is sewing her dress.\n\nb. Kandyon a basbasaenna dagiti suratmo. He is always reading your letters.\n\nA verb is continuative when the action is on-going, whether in the present or in the past, and customary when the action is done on a recurring basis.\n\nB. Culture When announcing one’s self as a visitor, it is not normal to knock on the door of an llokano home. It is usual to call, Adda tdo, Apo! Literally: There is a person, Sir! The response from within is usually Sumrekka (Come in) or Umulika (Come\n113\n\n\fup).

In Lesson Three we noted that many adjectives arc formed by prefixing na- to the root word:\n\nnasaydat nagaget naimbag\n\nfine industrious good\n\nThere are, however, many adjectives which do not have any affixes at all. Some of these begin with a, which is an old adjective-forming prefix which is no longer used as a prefix and just forms part of the root word:\n\nababa asideg\n\nshort near\n\n112\n\n\fadayo atiddog akdba akɪkid\netc.\n\nfar long wide narrow\n\nA number of adjectives are simply root words:\n\ndakkel bassit ddan baro\netc.\n\nbig small old new\n\nOther adjectives are formed with a ma- prefix:\n\nmabisin\n\nhungry\n\nmabain\n\nshy\n\nmabuteng\n\nafraid\n\nmasakit\n\nsick\n\n6. In Lesson Six, we learned about CVC-reduplication, and some of its meanings. We noted how with actor-focus verbs it gives either a. continuative or b. customary meaning. The same meanings occur when CVC- is used on patient­ focus verbs:\n\na. Dddaitenna ti badona. She is sewing her dress.\n\nb. Kandyon a basbasaenna dagiti suratmo. He is always reading your letters.\n\nA verb is continuative when the action is on-going, whether in the present or in the past, and customary when the action is done on a recurring basis.\n\nB. Culture When announcing one’s self as a visitor, it is not normal to knock on the door of an llokano home. It is usual to call, Adda tdo, Apo! Literally: There is a person, Sir! The response from within is usually Sumrekka (Come in) or Umulika (Come\n113\n\n\fup).

                "content": "been to provide natural speech, using language which is normal and appro­ priate to the context of interaction. In order to do this it often has been nec­ essary to introduce a variety of grammatical constructions or verb forms within a single dialog.\nEach new grammatical point is discussed in the Grammatical Notes and a variety of exercises is provided to help students understand and use these forms. The teacher should make sure that the students grasp the usage of each new grammatical point, and should be ready to supplement the drills and activities as necessary to meet the students’ needs.\nSlower students should be paired with faster students at least half of the lime. This gives the slower student the opportunity to learn from his peer, and provides the faster student with a sense of importance in being able to help someone else learn what he has learned. Frequent interchange of part­ ners of varying abilities will help the faster student to obtain the stimulation needed to continue his own learning.\nIn devising the methodology used in this text, I have been inspired by a number of stimulating works on the teaching of foreign language, all of which are oriented toward the development of communicative competence in the target language.

                "content": "been to provide natural speech, using language which is normal and appro­ priate to the context of interaction. In order to do this it often has been nec­ essary to introduce a variety of grammatical constructions or verb forms within a single dialog.\nEach new grammatical point is discussed in the Grammatical Notes and a variety of exercises is provided to help students understand and use these forms. The teacher should make sure that the students grasp the usage of each new grammatical point, and should be ready to supplement the drills and activities as necessary to meet the students’ needs.\nSlower students should be paired with faster students at least half of the lime. This gives the slower student the opportunity to learn from his peer, and provides the faster student with a sense of importance in being able to help someone else learn what he has learned. Frequent interchange of part­ ners of varying abilities will help the faster student to obtain the stimulation needed to continue his own learning.\nIn devising the methodology used in this text, I have been inspired by a number of stimulating works on the teaching of foreign language, all of which are oriented toward the development of communicative competence in the target language.

In Lesson Five we noticed that cer­ tain adverb-like words, such as pasaray, masansan, and kandyon, can be joined to a verb with a linker. These form a compound predicate. A number of other words can also\n\n94\n\n\fbe linked to a verb to form a compound predicate. Two such words are mabalin (can) and masdpol (necessary):\n\na. Mabalin a mapanka.\n\nYou can go.\n\nb. Masapol a mapanka.\n\nYou must go.\n\nOne other commonly occurring compound predicate con­ tains the patient-focus verb kayat with a KO set pronoun or a genitive noun phrase:\n\nc. Kayatna a mapanka.\n\nHe wants you to go-\n\nd. Kayat ni Juan a mapanka.\n\nJuan wants you to go-\n\nNotice that in examples c. and d. the agent of kayat (-na, ni Juan) and the subject of the sentence (-ka) must refer to different people. If they were the same (as in He wants to go), it would be necessary to use an embedded sentence in the subject as described above in section three of these notes:\n\ne. Kayatna ti mapan.\n\nHe wants to go.\n\nA patient-focus verb can also occur in a compound predi­ cate with kayat and a KO set pronoun or a genitive noun phrase, but the subject of the sentence must refer to another person:\n\nf. Kayatna a kitaen ni Maria.\n\nHe wants to see Maria.\n\nNotice that the agent of kayat and kitaen may be the same, as in f. above, or it may be different:\n\ng. Kayatna a kitaek ni Maria.\n\nHe wants me to see Maria.\n\nB. Culture\nChaperoning is still commonly practiced in the Philippines, especially in rural areas, and in the city when the family has rural associations. It is customary to have a younger sibling or cousin go along with an elder sister when she is invited out by someone of the opposite sex.\n\n95",

There isn’t any cat in the room.\nNotice that if a determiner is used with a subject following adda it becomes definite:\nc. Adda ti piisa idiay siled. The cat is in the room.\n3. Subject Determiners. The most general determiner used before subject common nouns is ti. However, there is another set of determiners that can be used before subject common nouns which parallel the demonstratives in mean­ ing. In fact, they are short forms of the demonstratives. They are not true demonstratives, however, because they cannot occur on their own without a following noun, nei­ ther can a linker occur between the short demonstrative and the noun. Notice the meanings of the subjects in the following examples:\na. Alaem man toy bagko. Please get this bag of mine.\nb. Nasakit ta lilom? Do you have a headache?\nc. Kitaem diay biɪɪit. Look at the bird.\nd. Ayan tay ɪibrok ditoy? Where is my book that was here before?\ne. Tinawagan ni Margarita di bosmo. Margarita called up your former boss.\n176\n\n\fIX. EXERCISES A. Translate the following sentences.\n\n1. Here it is.\n\n_________________________\n\n2. There it is. (near)\n\n_________________________\n\n3. There it is over there.\n\n________________________\n\n4. There is your comb, (near) ________________________\n\n5. Here is your necklace.\n\n________________________\n\n6. There are your earrings ________________________\n\nover there, (far)\n\n_________________________\n\n7. It is there, (near)",

Ditanto ti papanak.\n\nOver there is where 1’11 goThere is where I’ll go.\n\n5. Compound Predicates. In Lesson Five we noticed that cer­ tain adverb-like words, such as pasaray, masansan, and kandyon, can be joined to a verb with a linker. These form a compound predicate. A number of other words can also\n\n94\n\n\fbe linked to a verb to form a compound predicate. Two such words are mabalin (can) and masdpol (necessary):\n\na. Mabalin a mapanka.\n\nYou can go.\n\nb. Masapol a mapanka.\n\nYou must go.\n\nOne other commonly occurring compound predicate con­ tains the patient-focus verb kayat with a KO set pronoun or a genitive noun phrase:\n\nc. Kayatna a mapanka.\n\nHe wants you to go-\n\nd. Kayat ni Juan a mapanka.\n\nJuan wants you to go-\n\nNotice that in examples c. and d. the agent of kayat (-na, ni Juan) and the subject of the sentence (-ka) must refer to different people. If they were the same (as in He wants to go), it would be necessary to use an embedded sentence in the subject as described above in section three of these notes:\n\ne. Kayatna ti mapan.\n\nHe wants to go.\n\nA patient-focus verb can also occur in a compound predi­ cate with kayat and a KO set pronoun or a genitive noun phrase, but the subject of the sentence must refer to another person:\n\nf. Kayatna a kitaen ni Maria.\n\nHe wants to see Maria.\n\nNotice that the agent of kayat and kitaen may be the same, as in f. above, or it may be different:\n\ng. Kayatna a kitaek ni Maria.\n\nHe wants me to see Maria.\n\nB. Culture\nChaperoning is still commonly practiced in the Philippines, especially in rural areas, and in the city when the family has rural associations. It is customary to have a younger sibling or cousin go along with an elder sister when she is invited out by someone of the opposite sex.\n\n95",

Grammar\n1.\n\nPredicate SIAK Pronoun\nSiak\n\nSubject\nti [ । Noun\nni ।\n------ 1-------------------ti I Amerikano\n\nWhen a pronoun is used as the predicate of a sentence, the predicate or SIAK pronoun set is used. The complete set of SIAK pronouns is given in the Glossary.\n\nNotice the difference in meaning between the following two sentences.\n\na. Siak ti Amerikano.\n\nɪ am the American.\n\nb. Amerikano-ak.\n\nɪ am American.\n\nThe first sentence answers the question Sinno ti Amerikdno? (Who is the American?). The response, Siak (I), must occur as the predicate.\n\nThe second sentence answers the question Aniaka? (What are you?). The response, Amerikano, must occur as the predicate.\n2. Ilokano has three pronouns that are not distinguished in English. These will be explained here using the SIAK set, but the AK set and the KO set also contain pronouns with the same meanings.\n\na. English uses you whether you are speaking to one person or to more than one. In Ilokano sika (you) is restricted to one person; dakayo (you) is nor­ mally used for plural, but can be used for singular if the speaker is being polite.\n\nsika\n\nyou (singular)\n\ndakayo\n\nyou (plural), or you (singular, polite)\n\nb. In English, the pronoun we can be used if the speaker is talking about himself and his friends\n\n50\n\n\fand not including the person he is speaking to. Or it may include the hearer. In ɪlokano, three differ­ ent pronouns are used to mean we.\ndata we two. This pronoun is used if the speaker includes only one other person with him.\ndatayo we all. This pronoun is used if the speaker includes the person, or persons who are listening to him.\ndakami we not you. This pronoun is used if the speaker excludes the person or persons who are listening to him.\n\n3. Negative Questions And Their Responses. A negative question is formed just like a negative statement, using saan, but with different intonation:\n\na. Saanka nga Amerikano. You are not an American.\n\nb. Saanka nga Amerikdno? Are you not an American?",

John is an American.\n\nNegative:\n\nSaan nga Amerikano ni Juan. John is not an American.\n\nAny pronoun which occurs with the word which is the predicate is moved so that it attaches to saan. There are two situations when this can occur. The first is the moving of a genitive (KO set) pronoun from a predicate noun on to saan:\n\nPositive:\n\nGayyemko ni Marta. Marta is my friend.\n\nNegative:\n\nSaanko a gayyem ni Marta. Marta is not my friend.\n\nThe second is when a subject (AK set) pronoun attached to a predicate verb is moved on to saan. In a case like this the subject pronoun occurs in the middle of the predicate:",
