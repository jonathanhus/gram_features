Three or more examples of indefinite/non-specific nominals occurring with an indefinite/non-specific article is sufficient to code 1. \n\nAn indefinite article is a marker that accompanies the indefinite noun and expresses notions such as non-specificity and indefiniteness. Sometimes these notions of non-specificity and indefiniteness are summed up in the term ‘identifiability’. A language does not necessarily have both a non-specific/indefinite and a specific/definite marker. These markers often stem from very different sources (numerals and demonstratives) and need not be similar in formal expression or position. \n\nThe formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone. Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm of markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum, making it hard to define discrete categories. Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning ‘a certain’. As articles necessarily accompany nouns, it is in these cases that it is necessary to investigate whether the marker can occur independently or not; if it can it is most likely a pronoun and not an article. Articles can be homophonous with pronouns and demonstratives, and also with classifiers.\n\n",

The order may also depend on some other grammatical category which is neutral with respect to pragmaticality (e.g. definiteness).

            "summary": "This feature describes an adnominal property word denoting core adjectival concepts such as shape, value, dimension, age, color (at a minimum -- many other meanings are possible) which can be separated from the noun it modifies by some element that is not part of the nominal phrase. For example, can you say ***the man** is running **big*** to mean ‘**the big man** is running’? \n\nTypically a language which allows this has extensive [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) systems so that you can still work out what modifies what in the NP without them being adjacent (e.g. the ‘Australian type’). NPs that are made up of several coordinated NPs that can be interpreted by the verb or other elements are not relevant here. This features aims specifically to capture the phenomenon of a single NP whose property words can occur outside of and not immediately adjacent to the portion of the NP that contains the head. Examples of the type *I painted the house red* or *I saw the boy big* are not necessarily discontinuous, but most likely resultative or contrastive (*I saw the boy big* [as opposed to before when he was small]). These should be disregarded for the purposes of this feature.\n\nNote that for the purposes of this feature only property words (e.g. *tall*, *red*, *friendly*) should be considered. Any other elements described as 'adjectives' or 'adjectival' in the grammatical description (e.g. quantifiers, demonstratives) should be disregarded in coding this feature.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Code 1 if there are any sentences illustrating noun phrases where the adnominal property word is separated from the noun phrase whose head it modifies, such as *The man is running big.* to mean ‘The big man is running.’\n2.

Code 1 if the grammar specifically states that the language allows adnominal property words to occur in a position separated from the remainder of the nominal phrase whose head they modify.\n4. If discontinuous adnominal property words are not mentioned and there are no example sentences that show this phenomenon, code 0.\n5. If there is an extensive agreement system, exhaust all resources to discover whether discontinuous adnominal property words are possible, even if they are not mentioned in the grammar.

To see whether an element is comitative or coordinating you can check case marking and agreement.

Time Adverbs. There are a number of adverb-like time words which commonly occur in sentences that have eontinuative verbs. A number of these are joined to the verb by a linker:\n81\n\n\fKanayon a mapmapan ni Josie idiay balayda. Josie is always going to their house.\n\nMasansan nga agwatwatwdtak. ɪ often exercise.\n\nPasaray a bumisbisɪta ditoy. She sometimes visits here.\n\nTime words like bigat. malem, and rabii become time adverbs by inserting -in- before the first vowel:\n\nbinigat minalem rinabii inaldaw linawas binulan tinawen\n"

For the purposes of this feature we define third person pronouns as including demonstratives. A masculine/feminine distinction is commonly encoded in third person pronouns, but distinctions in any other noun class/gender categories such as animacy also satisfy the criterion for coding a 1 for this feature. For languages with no third person independent pronouns or no noun class/gender distinctions in third person pronouns, a gender distinction in demonstratives would be sufficient to trigger a 1 here. If pronouns with just inanimate referents (or alternatively, just animate referents) agree with the noun class/gender of the corresponding noun that also suffices for 1. If a language has any gender distinction for third person pronouns but not for demonstratives, this is also sufficient for a 1.

If pronouns are used only for animate third person referents and demonstratives are used for inanimate third person referents, but no noun class/gender contrasts are encoded within the third person pronouns nor within the set of demonstratives, this can be interpreted as an animacy contrast in third person pro-forms and is sufficient for 1 coding.\n5.

            "summary": "This feature aims to cover any marking that marks that the reference contains entities associated with an entity X ('X and other people/things associated with X') instead of indicating additive plural ('several instances of X'). For example, _the King_**_-s_** _went to the market_ means several kings went. An associative plural interpretation of *-s* would be 'the King and his entourage went to the market'. This marking does not need to be bound to the noun. If the additive plural also has this function, this also counts.\n\nThe associative marker may be described as a pronoun. Comitative markers do not generally count. The marker should be linked to the person whom the others are associated with, and not the other way around. \n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Code 1 if there is a marker of the noun (bound or free) that instead of, or in addition to, marking additive plural ('several X') marks that the reference contains entities associated with X: 'X and other people/things associated with X'.\n2.

Plurals Of Nouns. We mentioned earlier (Lesson Three) that ti dso could mean the dog or the dogs, but that dagiti dso could only mean the dogs. Notice that in these exam­ ples, the word for dog did not change whether it was singu­ lar or plural. It is possible, however, to make a plural form of common nouns like aso, by adding a CVC- prefix. The different forms of CVC- are the same as were discussed earlier for comparative adjectives, i.e., VC- if the word starts with a vowel, and CV- if there is no middle conso­ nant:\n\nkaykayo tugtugaw as-aso al-alɪngo wdwdig\n\ntrees chairs dogs wild pigs streams\n\nThere is a set of nouns referring to human beings that require the plural form to be used if they are in fact plural. These nouns have a different way of forming the plural. They double the consonant that follows the first vowel of the word. Some also require the reduplication of the first CV- of the word. Compare the plural words in the follow­ ing list.\n\nsingular plural\n\ngrandchild father mother child offspring young man young woman old man old woman male female spouse person\n\napðko ama ina ubing anak baro balasang lakay baket lalaki babcii asawa tdo\n\nappðko amma inna ubbing annak babbaro babbaldsang lallakay babbaket lallaki babbdi assawa tattdo\n\n187\n\n\f3.

This feature focuses on whether the categories _masculine_ and _feminine_ are relevant for noun class/gender assignment in a given language. A contrast between these categories in a noun class/gender system serves as a minimal criterion for this feature to be coded 1. Languages that overtly mark only one of these categories (e.g. feminine, with an unmarked class interpreted as non-feminine) do encode the relevant distinction and should be coded 1. A language may encode other socially or culturally relevant gender distinctions, and there may be cross-linguistic and cross-cultural differences in the semantics and membership of masculine and feminine categories. A language may also categorize nouns based on other factors entirely (e.g. shape, animacy, phonological properties). For the purposes of this feature, grammatical categories other than masculine and feminine should be disregarded. \n\nThe use of these two specific categories in the definition of this feature is meant to enable consistent coding and interpretation of data for a narrowly-defined, cross-linguistically common distinction. This is not meant to represent social or cultural gender constructs or particular biological traits, nor is it intended to reflect the full diversity of grammatical gender systems. For more information on the difference between grammatical gender and social, cultural, and biological constructs or traits, see the [gender wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Grammatical-gender-and-other-notions-of-gender).\n\n",

            "question": "Is there overt morphological marking of present tense on verbs?",
            "summary": "This question aims to capture productive paradigms of overt tense marking. 'Morphological marking on the verb' means that the marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verb. The marking of tense can involve affixes, clitics, suppletion, tonal marking and/or reduplication. This feature aims to capture overt marking of present tense on the verb. Lack of other marking is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example some grammarians state that present tense is expressed by a certain aspect on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing present tense then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB082) and the feature on tense auxiliaries ([GB121](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB121)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing present tense, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.\n\nSometimes a language is described as having a past/non-past distinction. In this case, if there is an overt marker of non-past code the language as 1 for this feature (GB082), but 0 for the feature on future tense [GB084](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB084). Future tense needs to be more dedicated to actual future reference, whereas present tense has less strict demands on the scope of its function. This situation is mirrored for future/non-future which results in a 1 for GB082 and GB084 but a 0 for GB083 (if both have over markers). It is however not acceptable for a present tense marker to occur in both future and past contexts.\n\nIf there is a tense system with a \"hodiernal\" category, i.e \"the day of speaking\", that also includes past events of the same day, this is permissible to code as a present tense marker.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Find the section discussing tense in the grammatical description.\n2. If present tense is not explicitly defined, check the description of the other tenses (if there are any).\n3. Code 1 if present tense can be marked on the verb by an affix or clitic, suppletion, tonal marking or reduplication.\n4. Code 1 if present tense can be marked by a combination of morphology and an auxiliary or particle. In these cases, also code 1 for [GB121](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB121) on tense auxiliaries and/or [GB521](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB521) on tense particles.\n4.

Ikuyogmo ni Juan. Take Juan along.\nVerbs of speech, such as baga (say), arasdas (whisper), and pukkaw (shout), are prefixes with /- when the subject is what is said. It can be considered a transmitted patient:\ne. Ibagam ti pudno. Tell the truth.\nf. lyarasdasnanto kenka ti naganna. He will whisper his name to you.\n2. Location. In Lesson Five, we introduced the locative deter­ miner iti. A location need not be a place name, such as Baguio, or a common noun such as balay (house), a loca­ tion is used as the locative determiner before a personal noun. It is translated as to, from, with, at, depending upon the meaning of the verb:\na. Ibagam kenni Marciano ti kayatmo. Tell (to) Marciano what you want.\n\n144\n\n\fb. Saludsudenyo kenni Esteban. Ask (about it from) Esteban.\n\nc. Mapanka kenni Rogelio. Go to Rogelio.\n\nd. Kumiiyogka kenni Rogelio. Go with Rogelio.\n\nhi and kenni are used before singular nouns.

Verbs which have an /- prefix are patient-focus verbs also, just like -en and -an verbs. The subject of the sentence is the patient. Most verbs that take i- are those in which the patient is moved (usually away from or with the actor) by the action of the verb:\na. lbellengmo ti danom. Throw out the water.\nb. ɪpanmo daytoy payong idiay uneg. Take this umbrella inside.\nc. ɪpaw-itko dagitoy bangbangio idiay Pilipinas, ɪ will send these perfumes to the Philippines.\nd. Ikuyogmo ni Juan. Take Juan along.\nVerbs of speech, such as baga (say), arasdas (whisper), and pukkaw (shout), are prefixes with /- when the subject is what is said. It can be considered a transmitted patient:\ne. Ibagam ti pudno. Tell the truth.\nf. lyarasdasnanto kenka ti naganna. He will whisper his name to you.\n2. Location. In Lesson Five, we introduced the locative deter­ miner iti. A location need not be a place name, such as Baguio, or a common noun such as balay (house), a loca­ tion is used as the locative determiner before a personal noun. It is translated as to, from, with, at, depending upon the meaning of the verb:\na. Ibagam kenni Marciano ti kayatmo. Tell (to) Marciano what you want.\n\n144\n\n\fb. Saludsudenyo kenni Esteban. Ask (about it from) Esteban.\n\nc. Mapanka kenni Rogelio. Go to Rogelio.\n\nd. Kumiiyogka kenni Rogelio. Go with Rogelio.\n\nhi and kenni are used before singular nouns. If the nouns are plural, the determiners are kadagiti and kada:\n\ne. ɪtedmo dayta kankanen kadagiti ubbing. Give the rice cake to the children.\n\nf. Agteleponoka kada Julian. Call up Julian’s (Julian and his companions’) place.\n"

A ditransitive construction must allow overt expression of an agent, a theme and a recipient/addressee as separate NPs. The morphological marking of these arguments (e.g. accusative case, dative case vs. adposition marking) is irrelevant for counting a construction as ditransitive.\n\n‘Marking’ for the purposes of this feature includes both flagging (i.e. case and adposition marking) and [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) on the verb. 1 is primarily triggered by flagging. Only if there is no overt flagging for neither the P argument nor the recipient argument, indexing is considered. 1 covers both the ‘double-object construction’ and the ‘secondary-object construction’ of Haspelmath (2013).\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with argument flagging (i.e. case and adposition marking) and indexing. Check whether it discusses ditransitive verbs or ditransitive constructions. If not, search the grammar for examples with verbs expressing a physical transfer.\n2.

If only the P argument or only the recipient is overtly marked, code as 0.\n5. If neither the P argument nor the recipient are overtly marked, consider the indexing patterns on the verb.\n6. Code as 1 if the two arguments are indexed identically.\n5. If the indexing of the P argument differs from the indexing of the recipient, code as 0.\n6. If there is neither overt indexing not flagging for both P and the recipient, code as 1.\n7. Various relevant verbs might have different marking patterns. As the question is about the possibility of the recipient in a ditransitive construction to be marked like the transitive patient, code as 1 even if not all verbs follow this pattern and add a comment.\n8. Even if the author of the grammar explicitly states the language has no ditransitive verbs, still consider and code the marking of the arguments of verbs of a physical transfer.  \n\n",

            "summary": "Serial verb constructions are understood as per Haspelmath's definition [(2016: 296)](http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/Files/LL/Docments/Journals/17.3/LLN17.3-Haspelmath.pdf): \"A serial verb construction is a monoclausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element linking them and with no predicate–argument relation between the verbs.\"\n\nSerial verbs are different from [verb compounds](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB122) in that they are compositional. Haspelmath (2016) states that \"a serial verb construction must be a productive schematic construction such that the meaning of a concrete construct can be determined on the basis of the meanings of its parts and the construction meaning.\" By contrast, verbal compounds, which are phonologically bound, are lexicalized and often non-compositional.\n\nGrambank distinguishes serial verb constructions from clause-chaining (see [GB150](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB150)). Clause chaining involves a series of verbs where only one verb is inflected. For a construction to be a serial verb construction, it must align with Haspelmath's definition and not constitute an instance of clause chaining (i.e., there is no single inflected verb while the other verbs are without inflection). Nevertheless, a language may feature both serial verb constructions and clause chaining.\n\nSerial verb constructions are also different from light verb constructions, which are made up of a verbal element and a lexical stem which is not an inflected verb, jointly determining argument structure (see [GB123](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB123)).  \n\nThe term 'verb' here refers to words that can function as independent verbs in the language under consideration. Ideally, these verbs should be dynamic, as per Haspelmath's (2016) definition: \"Verbs are defined as dynamic event expressions that do not have special coding when used in predication function\". Serial verb constructions that are more restricted, such as applying solely to stative verbs (e.g., a verb meaning 'to be good'), should not be counted as 1. Be cautious with descriptions using \"auxiliary verbs\" and \"copulas\" as these typically do not qualify as serial verb constructions.\n\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Code 1 if two or more verbs can be juxtaposed, this verbal sequence functions as a single predicate, there is no predicate-argument relationship between the verbs, and it is not an instance of clause chaining (i.e., no single verb is inflected while the other verbs lack inflection).\n2. Code 0 if no descriptions or examples of serial verb constructions are found in an otherwise comprehensive grammar.\n3. Code ? if the only potential examples of serial verb constructions in a language can also be analyzed as verbal compounds.\n4. Code ? if there are no examples of serial verb constructions but there is reason to believe that the authors of your sources may have overlooked such constructions.\n\n",

            "summary": "\nA light-verb construction is a lexicalized complex predicate with two components: (1) a lexical stem which is not an inflected verb and (2) an inflectable verb, which is called the light verb. It is form-identical with a main verb, but used with a different meaning such that it ‘cannot be said to be predicating fully' (examples in English include _give a sigh_ or _take a plunge_) (Butt 2003).\n\nItems that can occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions are: (1) nouns (e.g. *do baby* in Ivorian English or *have sex* in English for ‘to copulate’), (2) adjectives (e.g. *make beautiful* in English), (3) non-inflectable items such as ideophones (e.g. *do ssss* for ‘to make an ssss sound’), or (4) verbs borrowed from other languages that do not inflect in the target language. \n\nRegular verbs cannot occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions, in the Grambank definition. This makes light verb constructions different from serial verb constructions and verbal compounding, which involve a sequence of more than one verb. Another difference is that there is a predicate-argument relationship between the light verb and the other lexical stem (e.g. in *do baby*, *baby* is the object of *do*), while in serial verb constructions the verbs do not have a predicate-argument relationship between them since they instead describe a sequence of events. \n\n",

            "question": "Is there a notably small number of verb roots in the language?",
            "summary": "This feature tracks languages with few members in the word class which is most commonly known as ‘verbs’. If the word class ‘verbs’ contains approximately 100 roots or less, the language qualifies for this feature.  \n\nA large part of the grammar may be devoted to constructions where a verb from the closed class combines with open-class items to form predicates in most sentences. If a grammar never remarks on the size of the verbal inventory this almost always means that the language does not have a small number of verbs in the sense of the present question. If a language has a small number of verbs in this sense, typically a description will say that there is a closed class of verbs with few members. \n\nIn such languages, it is typically the case that what is described by one verb in other languages is instead expressed by so called ‘light verb constructions’ (see [GB123](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB123)). For example, *do meeting* could express the meaning ‘to meet’. It is also possible for a language to have few verbs but no light-verb constructions.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Code 1 if there are fewer than 100 verbs in the language based on statements in a grammar or dictionary.\n2. Code 1 if the descriptions describes verbs as a very restricted word class with few members even if a precise number is not given.\n3. Code 0 if there is no mention of verbs being a restricted word class in any sense.\n\n",
            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/iloko/espiritu_ilokano1984_o.txt'}\nA: Saanen.\n\nNo.\n\n5. Adjectives. In Lesson Three we noted that many adjectives arc formed by prefixing na- to the root word:\n\nnasaydat nagaget naimbag\n\nfine industrious good\n\nThere are, however, many adjectives which do not have any affixes at all. Some of these begin with a, which is an old adjective-forming prefix which is no longer used as a prefix and just forms part of the root word:\n\nababa asideg\n\nshort near\n\n112\n\n\fadayo atiddog akdba akɪkid\netc.\n\nfar long wide narrow\n\nA number of adjectives are simply root words:\n\ndakkel bassit ddan baro\netc.\n\nbig small old new\n\nOther adjectives are formed with a ma- prefix:\n\nmabisin\n\nhungry\n\nmabain\n\nshy\n\nmabuteng\n\nafraid\n\nmasakit\n\nsick\n\n6. In Lesson Six, we learned about CVC-reduplication, and some of its meanings. We noted how with actor-focus verbs it gives either a. continuative or b. customary meaning. The same meanings occur when CVC- is used on patient­ focus verbs:\n\na. Dddaitenna ti badona. She is sewing her dress.\n\nb. Kandyon a basbasaenna dagiti suratmo. He is always reading your letters.\n\nA verb is continuative when the action is on-going, whether in the present or in the past, and customary when the action is done on a recurring basis.\n\nB. Culture When announcing one’s self as a visitor, it is not normal to knock on the door of an llokano home. It is usual to call, Adda tdo, Apo! Literally: There is a person, Sir! The response from within is usually Sumrekka (Come in) or Umulika (Come\n113\n\n\fup). In traditional Ilokano society, the latter would be most commonly used because houses are set on poles, and access to the house is up the house ladder called agdan.\n\nIX. EXERCISES\nA. Write the continuative forms of the following verbs. The underlined portion is the root word.\n\naglɪito aglaba\n\nʌglutluto 'ʃʊ] 1 '1\nu\n\nni Juan ita. Juan is cooking now.\nti ubing idiay banio. The child is washing clothes in the bathroom.\n\naginana\n\nU æ I’m resting.\n\nagadal\n\nkayo, ania? You (plural) are studying, aren’t you?\n\nmangala mangardmid\n"

By clausal objects here we mean clauses that are directly governed by a finite verb (often verbs of ‘wanting’, ‘saying’, etc.). In other words, complement clauses are a specific type of subordinate clauses and are not relative clauses. For example, the objects in _I like **apples**_ (nominal object) and _I like **that you play the piano every morning**_ (clausal object) are in the same position (SVO). Many of the languages that do not place clausal objects in the same position as nominal objects are SOV languages that use SVO order for (long) clausal objects. This question aims to discern whether these clausal objects are treated like prototypical nominal direct objects (not indirect or obliques). This is not always explicitly stated by the descriptive work, but an investigation into the examples and perhaps even appended text of the grammar should typically reveals evidence for answering this question. \n\n",

            "summary": "Clause-chaining involves sequences of medial clauses (i.e. formally reduced or restricted clauses that do not have the full marking that usually occurs on the verb) which are dependent on a single, fully inflected verb that often (but not always) occurs in final clause. Clause chains may also be referred to as topic chains or as sequences of medial clauses/medial verbs. Crucially, this construction involves a single clause with a full, unrestricted, finite verb form and medial clauses that are dependent on it for specification of inflectional categories (e.g. TAM). \n\nClause chains are often used to describe sequences of events, and the medial verbs involved may be marked by [special affixes to indicate temporal relationships](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB152). Clause chains may also include markers of [switch reference](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB151). Medial verbs in some languages may be marked in the usual way for person/number of their arguments, though they generally lack some other canonical verbal inflection or involve specific marked verb forms that cannot be used in freestanding clauses. \n\nThere is considerable debate regarding the syntax of clause chaining generally and within individual languages. This construction is not merely a series of juxtaposed minimal clauses, as it requires dependency on one fully specified clause for full interpretation. It is also not straightforwardly a series of subordinated clauses (as in the series of temporal adjuncts in English, *Before he ate, while he was cooking the soup, he added salt.*). The syntactic relationship between clauses in clause chains is often described as a special type of coordination or a form of cosubordination.\n\nIn some cases clause-chaining may be difficult to distinguish from [serial verb constructions](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB118). Remember that a serial verb construction involves a set of verbs or verb phrases that function as a single predicate, whereas clause-chaining involves a set of *clauses* with formally reduced verbs, all dependent on a single fully specified verb form. Clause-chaining is also different from [verb compounding](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB122) in that the clauses in clause chaining are [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) and express separate propositions, which is not the case for verb compounding. In cases where it is unclear which of these constructions is represented by the examples in the grammar, a ? may be coded, but be sure to indicate in the comments that you were unable to determine which of these constructions is demonstrated in the relevant examples.\n\n",

Some languages (e.g. Kashaya) signal switch reference by using different allomorphs of TAM markers depending on whether the subject of the following clause is the same or different. Some systems (e.g. Southeastern Pomo) only have special morphology to indicate different subjects, whereas the contrasting morphological pattern that is used for coreferential subjects can also be used for some combinations of clauses with different referents.\n\nIn some languages the prominent argument that serves as the pivot of switch reference is the topic, rather than strictly the grammatical subject of the clause.\n\n",

Unsurprisingly, then, logophoric pronouns are found in reported speech contexts. This question concerns the existence of a special pronoun that specifically refers to the speaker/thinker/feeler in a reported speech construction. This special pronominal form occurs commonly in the complement clause of a speech or thought verb to designate the speaker/thinker/feeler (who is often also the subject of the speech/thought verb) as its referent.\n\n",

And if this pronoun has a different form than the third person personal and reflexive pronouns, then code 1.\n3. If the logophoric pronoun meets the criteria in (1) and (2) above, but is derived from another pronoun, code 1.\n4. If there is no difference in the pro-form used when the referent in a reported speech clause is the individual whose speech is reported vs. a different individual, code 0.\n\n",

For this feature to be coded 1, there must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of specific phonological properties. That is, some phonological property of a noun must be one relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment. Examples of phonological properties that may play a role in gender/class assignment include tone, initial consonants, or root-final segments. Note that noun class/gender morphology may create phonological similarities across members of a certain noun class or gender; however, this is not sufficient for a 1 coding for this feature.

This masculine/feminine distinction is a minimal contrast required for the coding of this feature, but other gender categories may also be encoded in second person pronoun forms. Pronoun systems that encode other grammatical gender/noun class categories in second person forms in the absence of a masculine/feminine distinction are not sufficient to satisfy this criterion. Languages that qualify for a 1 code for this feature will include a distinction between masculine and feminine forms in at least some categories of second person independent pronouns, but possibly not all categories. In many languages this contrast occurs only in the singular pronouns; that is, there is a contrast between masculine and feminine forms for second person singular, but not for second person plural (or dual, or any other non-singular number category). In some languages there is a contrast in multiple number categories, including singular and some non-singular number categories. It is uncommon for a language to have a masculine/feminine contrast in non-singular second person pronouns but not in the singular pronouns. However such languages would also satisfy the criteria for this feature.

It is possible to answer 1 or 0 for one of the binarised features, and \"?\" for the other. It is possible that there is no adnominal collective universal quantifier, in which case GB203, GB203a and GB203b are all 0 (see procedure).\n\nAs with other word order features in this database, this is focused specifically on adnominal quantification in pragmatically unmarked contexts. In languages that do not have a distinction between collective and distributive universal quantifiers (‘all’ vs. ‘every’), a quantifier that could be translated as ‘all’ and has a primarily plural use will be a sufficient target for this feature.\n\nThere are four possible codes for this feature, reflecting the fact that the collective universal quantifier might occur strictly before or strictly after the noun, may be allowed in both of these relative positions, or may not be present in a language. A 0 code is also applicable when the language does not allow a basic construction with an adnominal collective universal quantifier and a noun (e.g. if only a floating construction is used).\n\nOrders that result from constructions like quantifier float (e.g. English *The children have **all** come.*) should be disregarded for the purposes of coding this feature. \n\n",

This feature concerns clauses where the possessum is the subject of an existential predicate and the possessor is coded as an oblique argument, marked by an element meaning ‘to/for’ or by a dative marker (e.g. *car is to me*, *car is for me*, meaning ‘The car is mine’, or ‘I have a car’). The possessor-NP need not be marked for dative case. The dative meaning can be expressed on the verb itself, e.g. with a benefactive extension.\n\nThis type of predicative possession construction is known as the ‘dative possessive’, a subcategory of the ‘locational possessive’, in the work of Stassen (2000, 2001, 2003).\n\n",

Typically, the standard of comparison is the direct object, the object of comparison is the subject, and there are two predicates: one expressing ‘surpass/exceed’, and one carrying relevant lexical information about the property under comparison (e.g. *Ronald exceed be-tall Julia.*, meaning ‘Ronald is taller than Julia.’). \n\nThough this typical structure is quite common in languages that have a ‘surpass/exceed’ comparative construction, only the use of a ‘surpass/exceed' form is required for this feature; it is not necessary for the standard to occur as a direct object or the thing being compared to serve as the subject in order to trigger a 1 value. The order of these predicates is not relevant for this feature, nor whether the property word is a verb or an adjective.

In order to do this it often has been nec­ essary to introduce a variety of grammatical constructions or verb forms within a single dialog.\nEach new grammatical point is discussed in the Grammatical Notes and a variety of exercises is provided to help students understand and use these forms. The teacher should make sure that the students grasp the usage of each new grammatical point, and should be ready to supplement the drills and activities as necessary to meet the students’ needs.\nSlower students should be paired with faster students at least half of the lime. This gives the slower student the opportunity to learn from his peer, and provides the faster student with a sense of importance in being able to help someone else learn what he has learned.

            "summary": "This feature explores whether a language employs tone to differentiate between declarative and polar interrogative sentences. In the context of this feature, 'tone' refers to pitch variations tied to specific positions within a word or a clause, and not to global intonation patterns affecting the whole clause. A language exhibits this feature if one or more words in a declarative sentence can alter their tone to convert the sentence into a polar question. \n\n",
            "procedure": "\n1) Determine if there is lexical or grammatical tone in the language (other than for polar interrogation)\n2) if so, and if one of the words in a declarative sentence can change its tone to change the sentence into a polar question then code 1.\n\n",

In order to do this it often has been nec­ essary to introduce a variety of grammatical constructions or verb forms within a single dialog.\nEach new grammatical point is discussed in the Grammatical Notes and a variety of exercises is provided to help students understand and use these forms. The teacher should make sure that the students grasp the usage of each new grammatical point, and should be ready to supplement the drills and activities as necessary to meet the students’ needs.\nSlower students should be paired with faster students at least half of the lime. This gives the slower student the opportunity to learn from his peer, and provides the faster student with a sense of importance in being able to help someone else learn what he has learned.

When -/ɪ attaches to a pronoun which would otherwise lose its final vowel, the vowel is retained, e.g.,\nkldse-k klase-ko-n\nklase-m klase-mo-n\n\n5.\n\nPredicate\n\nAgent\n\nSubject\n\nPatient Focus Verb\n\nKO set Pronoun ti/ni Noun\n\nAKset Pronoun ti/ni Noun\n\nAll verbs which have ɑg-, mung-, and -urn- (and a few verbs which have ma-) attached to them can be called actor focus verbs. In other words, the actor of the action is the subject of the sentence. However, when a verb has a patient (sometimes called an object) which is a pronoun, a personal noun or a definite noun phrase (that is, one which can be translated with the, but not a), Ilokano always makes the patient the subject of the sentence, e.g.,\n\nPredicate Agent\nKayat''ko i i I\nKayadko Kayatjko\n\nSubject ni Juan.\nisiina. ti libro.\n\nI like John. (John is liked by me.) I like him. I like the book.\n\nVerbs, like kayat, which indicate that the subject of the sentence is not the Actor but is the patient, are called\n\n66\n\n\fpatient-focus verbs. Notice the word order, predicate first, agent second, subject (patient) third. Notice also that the agent pronouns are the same set that is used for possessor. This is why the KO set is sometimes called genitive, be­ cause it is used for agents as well as possessors.\n\nIX. EXERCISES\n\nA. Add a locative word or determiner to the following sentences.\n\n1.

This feature covers all grammatical moods, including declarative. The mood marker may be polysemous with other markers.\n\nThere are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle.

Grammatical marking of evidentials involves the use of grammaticalized markers such as affixes or other morphology, evidential particles, or evidential auxiliary verbs to convey the evidential meaning, in contrast to constructions that create this meaning through the use of adverbs (e.g. *John **reportedly** ate the cake*) or lexical verbs in multi-clause constructions (e.g. *They **say** that John ate the cake*). Indirect evidentiality usually involves inference from physical evidence or second-hand knowledge such as hearsay. This question should be coded 1 if there is a single category of indirect evidentiality or any number of inferential or reportative evidential categories that are marked grammatically.\n\n",

Body-part tallying systems are usually only used in some social situations, such as traditional bride price negotiations. Some languages with decimal, quinary or vigesimal systems use words for *head* or *body* to represent *10* or *20*, the word for *hand* to mean *5* or the word for *eye* to mean *1*. These do not count as body-part tallying systems in the absence of a sequence of other body-part tally points. \n\n",

A-lability stands for agent-preserving lability, that is the A argument is preserved in the intransitive construction, as in _**John**_[A] _drinks tea / **John** drinks_. \n\nThis question asks only about P-labile verbs. Semantically, two things can happen with P-labile verbs. In case of (a) argument structure modifying P-lability, an otherwise transitive verb is used in the intransitive construction encoding an argument structure from which the A argument of the transitive construction is absent. In case of (b) less common argument structure preserving P-lability, the verb in its intransitive use implies the same participants with the same roles as in its transitive use, but in the intransitive use, the A argument is not expressed and is interpreted as non-specific.\n\n",

            "summary": "This feature asks whether there are different second person pronoun forms that are used based on the level of respect accorded by the speaker to the addressee. In some cases polite pronouns are used to indicate a level of formality or unfamiliarity between speaker and addressee. In other cases politeness distinctions are used according to very specific social relationships between speaker and addressee, such as relative age, social status, or kinship. If multiple second person pronoun forms exist in a single number category, and their use is patterned according to the level of intimacy or hierarchy of social relationship between speaker and addressee, this will suffice for a 1 code. The contrastive forms may or may not have other uses (e.g. in French the form *tu* is used only for second person singular informal, while *vous* is used for both second person singular polite and second person plural); a politeness distinction triggers a 1 for this feature regardless of whether the relevant forms have other functions/meanings.\n\n",

And if the contrast between those pronoun forms is used to indicate respect or intimacy, or if the pronouns differ according to social relationships between the speaker and the addressee, code 1.\n3. If multiple second person pronoun forms exist for any number category but their usage does not reflect social relationships, intimacy or respect, then code 0.\n4. If there are not multiple second person pronoun forms for any number category, code 0.\n5. If there are multiple pronominal forms that are used for second person meanings that express a distinction in politeness, and these forms are also used to express other distinctions in the pronoun paradigm, this is sufficient to code 1.\n\n",

These markers are often described as ‘[particles](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles)' in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking. \n\nThere are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that a mood is expressed by a certain form on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing mood then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB519) and the feature on bound mood marking ([GB312](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB312)).
