Moreover, since no constituent may follow the case marker, I assume that a node N\" separates the determiner noun from its case marker.\n\nThere are several reasons for this NP structure. First of all, there is no subcategorisation between the case marker and the rest of the NP. Furthermore, the case marker (CM) is obligatory and always comes last, even when there is a full determiner (with case markings). There is also evidence from relative clauses that demonstrates that the CM is on the rest of the NP. Take for instance:\n\n(1) nu-laal thing2 phur3 in maiden wood carryII ERG The wood that the maiden carried ...\n\nIn the above example, the CM is over the relativised construction, which is an incorporated object. The above example in its main clause form is:\n\n(2) I}u-laal in thing2 ft1 a phurl maiden ERG wood ABS 3NOM carry The maiden carried firewood.\n\nEvidence from phonology also favours the analysis that the CM is a separate word. Take for instance the GLIDE HARDENING RULE2 which operates over phonological word boundaries only. The case marker is affected by this rule so that we get:\n\n(3) //thou + in// --+\n\nfly\n\nERG\n\n/thou vin/\n\nThus, the basic unmodified NP would have a structure\n\n(4)\n\nNP\n\nN\"\n\nN'\n~\n\nDPRO\n\nN'\n\nI\n\nl\n\nhee3-ng\n\nN\n\nherLPL\n\nI\n\nvok\nI\npig\n\n'these pigs'\n\nCM\n\nl\n\nDET\n\n0\n\nl\n\nhil\nI\nthis\n\n\fThe grammar ofsimple clauses in Mizo 97\n\nIt is claimed that the demonstrative pronoun and the determiner demarcate the extremities of the NP because they occur before the first and after the last in compound NPs, i.e.\n\n(5)\n\nNP\n\nN\"\n\n' CM\n\n~--------------- I\n\nN'\n\nDET 0\n\n~I\n\nN\n\nk?\n\nN\n\nSol\n\n/\\\n\nJd\n\n/\\\n\nI\nthat\n\nDPRO\n\nN'\n\nII\n\nhee2\n\nN\n\nh!re\n\nI\n\nDPRO\n\nN'\n\nII\n\nSoo2\n\nN\n\nthlre\n\nvok\n\nvok\n\nl\n\n.I\n\npig\n\npig\n\n'this pig here and that pig there'",

Compare the following examples:\n\n(48) a. kal nuu3 tel kal paa3 tel IP mother EX IP father EX my mother, father, etc.\n\nb. ka Juul tel kal cal\n\ntel\n\nIP head EX IP forehead EX\n\nmy head, forehead, etc.\n\nThe above examples clearly show that the particle te 1 does not indicate plurality even though it indicates a collection of subjects.

The more common NP quantifiers are: zong zong3 'each and every', trhen 1 khat 'some (of the whole)', vaai2 'all/everything', zaa 'all/every', tam2 tak 'several, many', deem2 tee2 'very few' and tin3 'each' (refer to section 2.6.3.3 for VP quantifiers). See also section 2.6.1.2 for plural markers.\nThese are examples of NP quantifiers:\n\n(47) a. aarl zong zong3 hen all all the hens\n\nb. aarl tam2 tak hen many INT many hens\n\nc. aarl deem 1 te2 hen few little few hens\n\nd. aarl hou3 hen group group of hens\n\ne. a2-n vaai2 inl a-n kall 3P-PL all OBLQ 3NOM-PL went they all went\n\nf. mii3 zong zong3 a-n kall\n\npeople all\n\n3NOM-PL went\n\nall the people went\n\ng. mi tin3 a-n kal 1 person each 3NOM-PL go each person went\n\nh. an-nii3 hou3 a-n kal 1 3PRO-PL group 3NOM-PL go they went (together)\n\ni. an hou3 te 1 a-n kal 1\n3P PL group EX 3NOM-PL go their party went\n\n\f112 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\n2.3.5.3 Plurality\nNumber is indicated either by morphology or by cardinal numbers. There is another optional plural particle, tel. When it occurs without the other number markers, tel has a slightly different meaning. In this instance, tel does not signify 'several of the specified item' but rather, 'the specified item plus others associated with it'. Compare the following examples:\n\n(48) a. kal nuu3 tel kal paa3 tel IP mother EX IP father EX my mother, father, etc.\n\nb. ka Juul tel kal cal\n\ntel\n\nIP head EX IP forehead EX\n\nmy head, forehead, etc.\n\nThe above examples clearly show that the particle te 1 does not indicate plurality even though it indicates a collection of subjects. Its true contribution, however, more resembles English etc. which indicates that the overt forms are merely examples of a longer list. Therefore, it is understandable that te 1 occurs in plural NPs, as the listed forms may only be indicative of a larger set, e.g.",

See also Lehman (1979b).\n\n2.3.5.1 Numeral quantifiers\nUnlike most other south-east Asian languages, Mizo does not have a semantically based system of noun classifiers, cf. Lehman (1979a). The numbering system, however, does display a · system of classifiers where the unit classifier is pa-, (as suggested by Lehman in personal communications). The classifiers for tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. are soom, zaa, saang2, respectively. The numbering system is decimal, as shown below:\n\n(39) a. pa-khat\n\none\n\nb. pa-nhi?\n\ntwo\n\nc. pa-thuml three\n\nd. pa-1iil\n\nfour\n\ne. pa-ngaa 1 five\n\nf. pa-ruk g. pa-sa-ri? h. pa-riat3 1. pa-kua2 J. soom\n\nsix seven eight nine ten\n\n\fThe grammar ofsimple clauses in Mizo 109",

Moreover, since no constituent may follow the case marker, I assume that a node N\" separates the determiner noun from its case marker.\n\nThere are several reasons for this NP structure. First of all, there is no subcategorisation between the case marker and the rest of the NP. Furthermore, the case marker (CM) is obligatory and always comes last, even when there is a full determiner (with case markings). There is also evidence from relative clauses that demonstrates that the CM is on the rest of the NP. Take for instance:\n\n(1) nu-laal thing2 phur3 in maiden wood carryII ERG The wood that the maiden carried ...\n\nIn the above example, the CM is over the relativised construction, which is an incorporated object. The above example in its main clause form is:\n\n(2) I}u-laal in thing2 ft1 a phurl maiden ERG wood ABS 3NOM carry The maiden carried firewood.\n\nEvidence from phonology also favours the analysis that the CM is a separate word. Take for instance the GLIDE HARDENING RULE2 which operates over phonological word boundaries only. The case marker is affected by this rule so that we get:\n\n(3) //thou + in// --+\n\nfly\n\nERG\n\n/thou vin/\n\nThus, the basic unmodified NP would have a structure\n\n(4)\n\nNP\n\nN\"\n\nN'\n~\n\nDPRO\n\nN'\n\nI\n\nl\n\nhee3-ng\n\nN\n\nherLPL\n\nI\n\nvok\nI\npig\n\n'these pigs'\n\nCM\n\nl\n\nDET\n\n0\n\nl\n\nhil\nI\nthis\n\n\fThe grammar ofsimple clauses in Mizo 97\n\nIt is claimed that the demonstrative pronoun and the determiner demarcate the extremities of the NP because they occur before the first and after the last in compound NPs, i.e.\n\n(5)\n\nNP\n\nN\"\n\n' CM\n\n~--------------- I\n\nN'\n\nDET 0\n\n~I\n\nN\n\nk?\n\nN\n\nSol\n\n/\\\n\nJd\n\n/\\\n\nI\nthat\n\nDPRO\n\nN'\n\nII\n\nhee2\n\nN\n\nh!re\n\nI\n\nDPRO\n\nN'\n\nII\n\nSoo2\n\nN\n\nthlre\n\nvok\n\nvok\n\nl\n\n.I\n\npig\n\npig\n\n'this pig here and that pig there'",

They form one phonological word where the second morpheme is some sort of modifier of the first morpheme. In a few cases, the meaning of the individual morphemes is opaque. The following words illustrate a number of these combinations:\n\n(19) a. saa3\nanimal\n\n+ mak strange\n\n= sa-mak\nrhinocerous\n\nb. faa3\n\n+ paa\n\noffspring\n\nmale\n\n= fd-paa = son\n\nc. mii3 person\n\n+ paa male\n\n= mi-paa = man/boy\n\nd. seer citrus\n\n+ thuur2 sour\n\n= seer-thuur2\nlemon\n\ne. bee3 beans\n\n+ tee2 small\n\n= be-tee2\ntype of bean\n\nNames of birds and animals are usually prefixed by vaa3 'bird' and saa3 'animal' respectively. However, in most cases the second morpheme is not a free form. For instance:\n\n\fThe grammar of simple clauses in Mizo 103\n\n(20) a. saa3 b. vaa3\n\n+ voml + rak\n\n= sa-voml = va-rak\n\nbear duck\n\nThus, the word is 'non-Fregean', that is, it cannot be divided into meaningful parts.\n\n(21) a. cingJ-nhia2 b. cai-ciiml c. fang3-mhiir d. be-raam\n\nwolf mouse ant sheep\n\n2.3.2.3 Nominalised nouns\n\nAbstract nouns are derived by nominalising adjectives or verbs (see also section 2.6.1.5).

This hierarchy also corresponds with the different syntactic structures o f the complement taking verbs. Thus, comparing Giv6n’s hierarchy where verbs o f manipulation display the highest degree of syntactic fusion we can see that Type 2 complements in Mizo fit this end of the scale. A t the other end are verbs o f cognition and utterance. Here again. Type 1.1 complements which display the syntax of finite verbs are direct-quote complements which is at the bottom of Givdn’s hierarchy.\n\nSummary",

Other important morphological categories include demonstrative pronouns, emphatic particles and numerical expressions. These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses. This chapter will discuss the morphological categories pertaining to noun phrases.\nCase marking will be dealt w ith first, followed by a discussion o f pronominal paradigms.

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Jre naaul le? soo naaul soo3-n in mil veel\nthis child and that child DET-ERG ERG IACC hit This child and that child hit me.\n\n2.6.2.3 Oblique marker\nThe oblique marker also marks instruments. Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

This will be mainly in the area of defining word boundaries. For the moment, I have decided to mark only two grammatical boundaries: morpheme boundaries are indicated by - and word boundaries are marked with a space. My decisions are based on the guidelines given by Hyman (1978) and Zwicky (1985). These boundaries correspond to phonological boundaries as follows: the phonological word corresponds to the grammatical phrase; internal word boundaries in phonology correspond to grammatical word boundaries; morpheme boundaries are the same, though they are much more significant in the grammar than in the phonology. I have not marked the grammatical phrase boundary as it is marked morphologically by the final case markers.\nThe following sections are an attempt to bring together the works mentioned above, using more recent linguistic tools. I have used terms, such as N', in the manner of Radford (1981) and the categorisations are based roughly on Giv6n's (1984) typological approach to syntax. Even though this paper will not get into the theoretical details, I will make theoretical assumptions based on current linguistic theories. In particular, the notion of ergativity will be a major consideration of the following sections. In this area I am indebted to Lehman's (1985) and DeLancey's (1981a) discussions of ergativity in TB languages.\n2.2 Noun phrase structure\nThe noun phrase structure of Mizo is fairly complex. The most characteristic feature of the NPs is that they can be demarcated on the left by a demonstrative pronoun and on the right by a case marker (CM). The obligatory case markers for the NP are preceded by the determiner: plurality markers and locational markers are suffixed on the demonstrative pronoun.",

These are some of the more important ones:\n\n2.6.1.1 Gender suffix\n\nAll proper names must have a gender suffix (see also section 2.3.2.4). The female gender suffix -i 1 and the male gender suffix -a are dropped in the vocative case, if the name is longer than two syllables. The vocative case is indicated by a low tone on the final syllable. For female names, the low tone of the vocative combines with the high tone of the affix so that the tone becomes a falling tone. Thus we get TONE CONTOURINGlO as in the case of determiners followed by ergative markers. (Tone contouring does not apply to male names because they are low tone in citation form.)

According to M atisoff (1972) Lahu, ve functions as a nominalizer, relativizer and as an indicator of genetivization. Genetti (1990) mentions that Newari subordinator gu(li) has a similar function. Modem spoken Tibetan has at least five diferent nominalizers.\nMizo, however, does not have an overt subordinating morpheme. It uses various syntactic devices instead. As indicated earlier, there is an agentive nominalizer which takes an independent verb stem .

They form one phonological word where the second morpheme is some sort of modifier of the first morpheme. In a few cases, the meaning of the individual morphemes is opaque. The following words illustrate a number of these combinations:\n\n(19) a. saa3\nanimal\n\n+ mak strange\n\n= sa-mak\nrhinocerous\n\nb. faa3\n\n+ paa\n\noffspring\n\nmale\n\n= fd-paa = son\n\nc. mii3 person\n\n+ paa male\n\n= mi-paa = man/boy\n\nd. seer citrus\n\n+ thuur2 sour\n\n= seer-thuur2\nlemon\n\ne. bee3 beans\n\n+ tee2 small\n\n= be-tee2\ntype of bean\n\nNames of birds and animals are usually prefixed by vaa3 'bird' and saa3 'animal' respectively. However, in most cases the second morpheme is not a free form. For instance:\n\n\fThe grammar of simple clauses in Mizo 103\n\n(20) a. saa3 b. vaa3\n\n+ voml + rak\n\n= sa-voml = va-rak\n\nbear duck\n\nThus, the word is 'non-Fregean', that is, it cannot be divided into meaningful parts.\n\n(21) a. cingJ-nhia2 b. cai-ciiml c. fang3-mhiir d. be-raam\n\nwolf mouse ant sheep\n\n2.3.2.3 Nominalised nouns\n\nAbstract nouns are derived by nominalising adjectives or verbs (see also section 2.6.1.5).

                "content": "This description of Mizo grammar will be comprehensive and it will also try to relate some of the grammatical features to the phonological system.. This will be mainly in the area of defining word boundaries. For the moment, I have decided to mark only two grammatical boundaries: morpheme boundaries are indicated by - and word boundaries are marked with a space. My decisions are based on the guidelines given by Hyman (1978) and Zwicky (1985). These boundaries correspond to phonological boundaries as follows: the phonological word corresponds to the grammatical phrase; internal word boundaries in phonology correspond to grammatical word boundaries; morpheme boundaries are the same, though they are much more significant in the grammar than in the phonology. I have not marked the grammatical phrase boundary as it is marked morphologically by the final case markers.\nThe following sections are an attempt to bring together the works mentioned above, using more recent linguistic tools. I have used terms, such as N', in the manner of Radford (1981) and the categorisations are based roughly on Giv6n's (1984) typological approach to syntax. Even though this paper will not get into the theoretical details, I will make theoretical assumptions based on current linguistic theories. In particular, the notion of ergativity will be a major consideration of the following sections. In this area I am indebted to Lehman's (1985) and DeLancey's (1981a) discussions of ergativity in TB languages.\n2.2 Noun phrase structure\nThe noun phrase structure of Mizo is fairly complex. The most characteristic feature of the NPs is that they can be demarcated on the left by a demonstrative pronoun and on the right by a case marker (CM). The obligatory case markers for the NP are preceded by the determiner: plurality markers and locational markers are suffixed on the demonstrative pronoun.",

It goes without saying that, for this particular aspect of phonological theory, I have been greatly influenced by concepts like the core:periphery distinction of the Prague School and the Prosodic Approach of the Firthian School.\nAd (4) :\nThe concept of rules holding a key position in generative theory must be subject to criticism as long as no further criteria are imposed re­ garding uncontrolled and unwarranted applications. Instead of applying criteria such as 'naturalness conditions' in phonology which, in its most ridiculous attempt, has amounted to counting symbols as sole indi­ cators of different degrees of complexity, I have developed a criterion which is based on plausibility considerations. The ’cost' with which the explanation by a rule is imputed, is, in my theoretical framework, immediately calculable by measuring the degree of plausibility with re­ ference to the explanatory value that is attached to every component of the morphophonological level. In this context, the reader may be re­ minded of the three kinds of possible concepts of measurement, viz., classificatory concepts (e.g., terms like warm, hot, cortd in measuring temperature), coi^ara^ve (or topological) concepts (e.g., terms like warmer than, as warm at , etc.), and metr^a1, that is, purety quantitarive, concepts ^.g. 20 degaees cent^rade} . The ^onoh^ca1 compo­ nents as introduced in this essay have been conceived as comparative terms.\nThroughout the book, phonetic forms have been put between square brackets in accordance with the conventions established by the Interna­ tional Phonetic Association (revised Inbernationot Phanetze Alphabet of 1951).\nThe translation of Lushai words has been taken over literally from\nIx",

I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes.

I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes.

The following examples are illustrative.\n\n( l) a . keel-in nhim a-pet goat-ERG grass 3s-graze 'A/the goat is eating/grazing grass.'\n\nb. khool-m-\n\npuin ka-thfly\n\nmachine-INSTR cloth ls-sew\n\n'I am sewing with a machine.'\n\nc. kdn-huan-a?\n\nkeel a-lhht\n\nls.pl-garden-LOC goat 3s-enter\n\n'A/the goat entered our garden.'\n\n\fErgative\n\nLike many languages of this area, Mizo is an ergative language. The ergative\n\nsuffix -in marks all transitive subjects, regardless of their semantic role.\n\n(2) a. ka-nbu-m\n\nmin-vua\n\nlPoss-mother-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My mother beat me.'\n\nb. ka-nhit\n\nle? ka-p^a-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nlPoss-m otherand lPoss-father-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My m other and my father beat me.'\n\nc. ka-p&a-in\n\nloom=man a-doq\n\nlPoss-father-ERG prize\n\n3s-receive\n\n'My father received a prize.'\n\nInstrumental/Adverbial\n\nThe instrumental case marker is -in. It also functions as an adverbializer.\n\n(3) a. Kim-&n\n\ntiaq-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nKim-MASC.ERG stick-INSTR lo-beat\n\nTGma hit me with a stick.'\n\nb.

This will be mainly in the area of defining word boundaries. For the moment, I have decided to mark only two grammatical boundaries: morpheme boundaries are indicated by - and word boundaries are marked with a space. My decisions are based on the guidelines given by Hyman (1978) and Zwicky (1985). These boundaries correspond to phonological boundaries as follows: the phonological word corresponds to the grammatical phrase; internal word boundaries in phonology correspond to grammatical word boundaries; morpheme boundaries are the same, though they are much more significant in the grammar than in the phonology. I have not marked the grammatical phrase boundary as it is marked morphologically by the final case markers.\nThe following sections are an attempt to bring together the works mentioned above, using more recent linguistic tools. I have used terms, such as N', in the manner of Radford (1981) and the categorisations are based roughly on Giv6n's (1984) typological approach to syntax. Even though this paper will not get into the theoretical details, I will make theoretical assumptions based on current linguistic theories. In particular, the notion of ergativity will be a major consideration of the following sections. In this area I am indebted to Lehman's (1985) and DeLancey's (1981a) discussions of ergativity in TB languages.\n2.2 Noun phrase structure\nThe noun phrase structure of Mizo is fairly complex. The most characteristic feature of the NPs is that they can be demarcated on the left by a demonstrative pronoun and on the right by a case marker (CM). The obligatory case markers for the NP are preceded by the determiner: plurality markers and locational markers are suffixed on the demonstrative pronoun.",

I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes.

The markers on the determiners can co-occur with the other marker, without causing any changes in the meaning, though the complete form sounds more emphatic. Thus, the ergative marker and the oblique marker are optional for determiners.

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

Only the deictic motion particles and the reciprocal/reflexive marker can come between it and the verb. See also section 2.3.2.5 for full form pronouns and pronoun clitics in NPs.

In Mizo, these are not verbs but preverbal particles which I call deictic motion particles (DMP). . The DMPs cliticise before main verb stems and cause the verbal complex to receive an interpretation of the subject's carrying out the action in a certain manner involving locomotion. In all instances it is the individual expressed by the pronoun, which immediately precedes the DMP, that moves.\nThe DMPs are limited to five lexical items: va 1 'away from the speaker'; rom 'towards addressee' in questions when the questioner is the subject and 'towards speaker' in all other cases; lou2 'toward speaker'; ham2 'up and away from speaker'; and zuk 'down and away from speaker'. These will also agree semantically with the demonstrative pronoun and determiner on NPs, i.e.\n(63) a. khiJ-ta? khi-anl han kall ro? up there DET-OBLQ up there go Hv1P Go up there!\n\n\fThe grammar of simple clauses in Mizo 119\n\nb. he 1-Jam I a? hi-an 1 ron son3 ro? this-side LOC DET-OBLQ hither move IMP Move it hither.\nc. kal ron da? doonl em2 nii lNOM thither put ASP Q be Should I (bring it and) put it there?",

Clitics are obligatory in certain constructions whereas particles are not.\n\n2.6.2.l Pronoun clitics\nAs mentioned earlier, pronoun clitics are tightly bound to whatever they precede.

Adverbs and direct object NPs are optional constituents of the VP just as in many other languages. The clitic pronoun, however, is required in every sentence (except for relative clauses, imperatives and subjectless wh-questions, cf. 3.4.1).

A second and very persuasive argument that the pronoun clitics require their own V-bar constituent (here V\") is seen in the behaviour of the second person accusative pronoun clitic eel 'you', eel ul 'you (pl)', cf. example 51 below.\n(51) a. mi-sual2 in a manl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch 2ACC A criminal has caught you.\nb. mi-sual2 in a manl doonl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch ASP 2ACC A criminal is going to catch you.\nAt present I know of no tests to decide which of the two clitics is higher in the structure.

Morphology will be dealt with in greater detail in section 2.6.\n\n2.5.1 Adverbs\nAdverbs generally precede the main verb. Manner adverbs can follow the main verb under certain circumstances. The adverbs are manner adverbs, adverbs of time and adverbs of place. The last two adverbs are very similar. Adverbs that precede the verb require some sort of modifier, such as the oblique marker or the locative marker. There is no such restriction on postverbal adverbs.\n\n2.5.1.1 Manner adverbs",

Since the verb is INTRANSITIVE, the ergative\n\npostposition cannot occur with the subject.\n\nAnother significant point worthmentioning regarding Mizo postpositions is that in interrogative sentences, postpositions are infixed i n :the interrogative marker tunge.

I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes.

The vocative case is indicated by a low tone on the final syllable. For female names, the low tone of the vocative combines with the high tone of the affix so that the tone becomes a falling tone. Thus we get TONE CONTOURINGlO as in the case of determiners followed by ergative markers. (Tone contouring does not apply to male names because they are low tone in citation form.) Consider the following examples:\n\n(110) a. Maaml-a b. Maaml-aa c. Maaml-il d. Maaml-ii3 e. Maaml-boi?-a\n-EMT-MSUF\nf. Maam 1-boi?-i1\n-EMT-FSUF\ng. Maaml-boi?\n\nMama (boy's nickname) Mama! (vocative) Marni (girl's nickname) Marni! (vocative) Mambawiha (usually firstbom son)\nMambawihi\nMambawih! (vocative)\n\n\f134 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\n2.6.1.2 Plural suffix\n\nPronouns are the only items marked for number. Each of the different types of pronouns have their own plural form. Thus, -nii3 is the plural marker for full pronouns, -n is the plural marker for subject pronoun clitics and -ng is the plural marker for the demonstrative pronouns. (See also section 2.3.1.1 and section 2.3.2.5.) For example:\n\n(111) a. kei2 ka :zaail lPRO lNOM sing I sing\n\nb. kei-nii3 ka-n\n\n:zaail\n\nlPRO-PL lNOM-PL sing\n\nwe sing\n\nc. ka zaail lNOM sing I sing\n\nd. ka-n\n\nzaai 1\n\nlNOM-PL sing\n\nwe sing\n\ne. hee noul hil DPRO cup DET this cup\n\nf. hee3-ng noul hiJ DPRO-PL cup DET these cups\n\nThe plural marker for the demonstrative pronoun is restricted to non-humans. Thus one cannot have:\n\n(112)\n\n*hee3-ng mii3 hil DPRO-PL cup DET these people\n\nInstead, the preferred form is:\n\n(113)\n\nhee mii3 tel hil DPRO person EX DET these people and such",

I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes.

                "content": "11.3. The Nature of the Verb in Relative Clauses\n\nThere is another fact with regard to the embedded verb in relative clauses.The embedded .verb in relative clauses occurs in the finite form when the subject is modified. Though the verb of the embedded relative is t+finite], it does not carry any agreement marker.: The absence of the agreement marker is\n\nifi*\n\n-\n\n\fdenoted by 0 in the ^fehtiences given above. This deserves an\nexplanation. In relative clauses modifying the subject, it is\ni\nthe subject of the embedded relative which is not overtly present.\nThe data from complement clauses shows that the subject\nagreement marker does not occur when the subject noun phrase is\nnot overtly present (cf.chapter 9 on Complementation).This\nprovides an explanation as to why the agreement marker is absent in sentences in which the subject'is modified.When the subject is *modified , we have seen that the noun phrase in the embedded relative clause is not overtly present.Hence,no agreement marker on the embedded verb.\n\ntu. the agentive marker in Mizo is a very productive suffix and it can be suffixed only to finite stems. its occurrence with nohfinite verbs is ungrammatical. For example:\n\nFinite Verb + tu\n\nNonfinite Verb\n\nziak+tu\n\n1whiter'\n\nwrite[+FIN] thOk+tu\n\nj i 1worker'\n\nwork[+FIN]\n\nhmancr+tu\n\n'user'\n\nuse [+FIN]\n\ndOng +tu - 'receiver1\n\nreceive 1[+FIN]\n\n■*ziah +tu [-FIN] *thQh [-FIN] *hman ±£li [-FIN] *dQn +tu\n[-FIN]\n\n\fIt is the same tu which occurs in relative clauses too.\n\nSince in simple phrases requires a finite verb, in embedded\n\nrelatives too the finite verb is retained on the analogy of the\n\nsimple agentive phrases. Thus, we can say that the productive\n\npattern finite verb +tu exerts pressure on the embedded relatives\n\nmodifying a subject and thus the\no\nretained.\n\nfiniteness of the verb is\n\nIf the explanation provided above is correct, then the\n\npostnominal relatives in (1) and (2) must be treated as derived",

The retention of the agreement marker depends on the presence of the ergative marker.

Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone.

Only the deictic motion particles and the reciprocal/reflexive marker can come between it and the verb. See also section 2.3.2.5 for full form pronouns and pronoun clitics in NPs.

In Mizo, these are not verbs but preverbal particles which I call deictic motion particles (DMP). . The DMPs cliticise before main verb stems and cause the verbal complex to receive an interpretation of the subject's carrying out the action in a certain manner involving locomotion. In all instances it is the individual expressed by the pronoun, which immediately precedes the DMP, that moves.\nThe DMPs are limited to five lexical items: va 1 'away from the speaker'; rom 'towards addressee' in questions when the questioner is the subject and 'towards speaker' in all other cases; lou2 'toward speaker'; ham2 'up and away from speaker'; and zuk 'down and away from speaker'. These will also agree semantically with the demonstrative pronoun and determiner on NPs, i.e.\n(63) a. khiJ-ta? khi-anl han kall ro? up there DET-OBLQ up there go Hv1P Go up there!\n\n\fThe grammar of simple clauses in Mizo 119\n\nb. he 1-Jam I a? hi-an 1 ron son3 ro? this-side LOC DET-OBLQ hither move IMP Move it hither.\nc. kal ron da? doonl em2 nii lNOM thither put ASP Q be Should I (bring it and) put it there?",

PI.\n\n1\n\nka\n\nkin\n\n2\n\ni\n\nhr\n\n3\n\na\n\nin\n\nThe tone of the subject agreement prefix is the opposite of the endpoint of the tone\n\nin the following word (see Chapter II for details). Thus compare 1lb and c below:\n( 11) a. a-thflfl\n3s-sit 'S/he is sitting.’\nb . a-ron-thflfi 3s-come-sit 'S/he came and sat.’\nc. *a-ron-thfifl\n\nIn transitive clauses subject markers also precede the verb. However, when the\n\nobject is first person, the first person object marker precedes the verb and there is no\n\nsubject marker. Third person objects are unmarked and second person object markers\n\nfollow everything else except the clause final particle. I shall call all the agreement markers\n\npreceding the verb prefixes. Those following such as the second person obect marker, ce\n\nand the second person object marker flare phonologically not suffixes because they do not\n\ntrigger vowel reduction (see Chapter II). That is, we get forms like a-bia-ce ’s/he speaks to\n\nyou’ and not a-be-ce. However, for proposes of this thesis I will also treat them as\n\nsuffixes. Their current phonological difference is probably due to their historic\n\ndevelopment since prefixes in Tibeto-Burman verb agreement systems have different\n\nhistorical origins from suffixes.\n\n\f91\n\nThe transitive verb agreement paradigm is as follows:",

Part of the complexity comes from the numerous particles that accompany the main verb. In many instances, it is very difficult to decide if the particle is an innovation in the language or if it is derived from some other source. Take for example the subject pronoun clitic. It appears in many of the related languages (such as Laai Chin, Hmar, Thadou) but its phonological form and usage varies widely . from language to language. Even in languages that are more distant relatives of Mizo, verb morphology continues to be a rather complex and controversial issue. Furthermore, it is difficult to find sufficient data for comparison as one has to rely mostly on isolated examples cited in the literature. It would be much easier to analyse and compare the syntactic structure of related languages if one had access to a standard text in the various languages. Grierson's survey is helpful in this area as he uses the same text throughout, even when the data is not sufficiently marked for tone. Thus, it is beyond the scope of this paper to deal with the verb morphology in exhaustive detail.\n\n\fThe grammar ofsimple clauses in Mizo 113\n\nThe constituents to be discussed in this section are displayed in the chart below:\n\n(50)\n\nVP\n\n(ADVNP)\n\nV\"\n\nPRO\n\nV'\n\n~\n\nV'\n\nMOD\n\n~\n\nV'\n\nNEG\n\n~\n\nV'\n\nASP\n\n~\n\nV'\n\nAdv bl\n\n~\n\nDMP\n\nv",

Thus, Mizo exhibits a pure ergative system with regard to case marking and both ergative-absolutive and nominative- accussative patterns with regard to verb agreement.\nThe split ergative patterns exhibited in Mizo can also be explained in terms of the principle of the pronominal strength hierarchy. Notice that the pronominal suffixes occur with the verb. Since it is the number and person marker of the first person that are coded in the verb to its LEFT in the position where normally the agent agreement marker occurs as in (7) and (8) we can say that the first person object/patient is ’stronger than’ the second and third person subject/agent. 4.2.

Thus, Mizo exhibits a pure ergative system with regard to case marking and both ergative-absolutive and nominative- accussative patterns with regard to verb agreement.\nThe split ergative patterns exhibited in Mizo can also be explained in terms of the principle of the pronominal strength hierarchy. Notice that the pronominal suffixes occur with the verb. Since it is the number and person marker of the first person that are coded in the verb to its LEFT in the position where normally the agent agreement marker occurs as in (7) and (8) we can say that the first person object/patient is ’stronger than’ the second and third person subject/agent. 4.2.

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

However, there is no information about a verbal marker that indexes or marks the instrument directly on the verb. The instrumental marker appears to be a case marker applied to the noun phrase, and not as a bound morpheme or clitic on the verb. Therefore, based on the procedure, the language does not have an instrumental marker on verbs or index instruments on verbs.",

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

However, since both markers have the same phonological shape, it is possible that the reflexive or reciprocal detransitivises a normally transitive verb.\n\nMeteorological verbs are also intransitive:\n\n(77) a. rua'l a suurl rain 3NOM rains It is raining.\n\nb. kaoll a phee2 sky 3NOM flash There is lightning.\n\nAnother type of intransitive construction involves emotive verbs (inner emotions or physical · states).\n\n(78) a. kal luak3 al chuak3 IP vomit 3NOM come out I'm nauseated.\n\nb. kal thin al raim3 IP heart 3NOM works hard I'm angry.\n\n\fThe grammar of simple clauses in Mizo 123\n\n2.5.4.2 Transitive verbs\n\nTransitive sentences have the most complex morphology. The NPs display an ergativeabsolutive system and the verb has a largely nominative-accusative encoding system. That is, the subjects of both the intransitive verb and the transitive verb are encoded alike in the VP. In the NP, the ergative case marker is in, and the absolutive case marker is 1-1.\n\n(79) nau 1-pang1 in. aar1 fi1 al\n\nuum3\n\nchild\n\nERG chicken ABS 3NOM chase\n\nA child is chasing a chicken.\n\nThus, the terms 'subject' and 'object' in Mizo refer to what is encoded by the case markers. For instance, 'subject' in Mizo does not always involve an active agent, cf.\n\n(80) a. bangl in kil-liil\n\nfJ al nei\n\nwall ERG corner-four ABS 3NOM has\n\nA wall has four corners\n\nb. nin-lhei3 in tol-peengl fJ al nei mischief ERG consequence ABS 3NOM has Mischief has it's (undesirable) consequence.\n\nc. pi1-tar1 in Thang 1-kuur1-a fJ a rhiaa2\n\nwoman-old ERG\n\n-MSUF ABS 3NOM knows\n\nThe old woman knows Thangkura.",

The transitive 'object' and the intransitive 'subject' are marked with the absolutive marker in the NP. From here on, the terms 'subject' and 'object' will be used in this specialised sense.\n\nIf there is more than one subject, the ergative marker comes at the end of the NP.\n\n(81) naul-pang2 le? uil in aarl fJ a-n\n\nuum3\n\nchild\n\nand dog ERG chicken ABS 3NOM-PL chase\n\nA child and a dog are chasing a chicken.\n\nInstruments are marked with the oblique marker in 1, as in:\n\n(82) nau 1-pang 1 in tiang in 1 ui fJ al vuaa\n\nchild\n\nERG stick OBLQ dog ABS 3NOM hit\n\nA child is hitting a dog with a stick.\n\nWhen it comes to the object (direct or indirect), there is a further complication. If the object is first person, the object is marked before the verb, instead of a second or third person subject marker, as in:\n\n(83) Jal1 m mi haaul chief ERG lACC scold The chief scolded me.\n\n\f124 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\nThe first person accusative marker is phonologically unstable: it does not always follow the PRONOUN CLITIC TONE SANDill RULE6 (cf. 84a, b) and also alternates with the plural form (cf. 84c). So, one can get any of the following synonymous sentences:\n\n(84) a. mi 1 IX'? ro'l lACC give IMP Give it to me.\n\nb. mi IX ro'l lACC give IMP Give it to me.\n\nc. min2 IX ro'l lACC-(PL) give IMP Give it to me (us).\n\nNowadays, many people use the last example, 84c, for either singular or plural.\n\nIf the object is second person, it is marked both nominative and accusative (the only time there is an accusative marking) so that we get:\n\n(85) lall in a haaul eel chief ERG 3NOM scold 2ACC The chief scolded you.\n\nIf the object is third person, there is no marking, as in:\n\n(86) la/ 1 in a\n\nhaau 1 ~\n\nchief ERG 3NOM scold 3ACC\n\nThe chief scolded him/her.",

I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes.

Adverbs and direct object NPs are optional constituents of the VP just as in many other languages. The clitic pronoun, however, is required in every sentence (except for relative clauses, imperatives and subjectless wh-questions, cf. 3.4.1). Therefore, I assign it to a special level of the VP called V\". The remaining particles for mode, negation, aspect, etc. are optional again. So these can be dominated by a recursive V' constituent. A second and very persuasive argument that the pronoun clitics require their own V-bar constituent (here V\") is seen in the behaviour of the second person accusative pronoun clitic eel 'you', eel ul 'you (pl)', cf. example 51 below.\n(51) a. mi-sual2 in a manl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch 2ACC A criminal has caught you.\nb. mi-sual2 in a manl doonl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch ASP 2ACC A criminal is going to catch you.\nAt present I know of no tests to decide which of the two clitics is higher in the structure.

Morphology will be dealt with in greater detail in section 2.6.\n\n2.5.1 Adverbs\nAdverbs generally precede the main verb. Manner adverbs can follow the main verb under certain circumstances. The adverbs are manner adverbs, adverbs of time and adverbs of place. The last two adverbs are very similar. Adverbs that precede the verb require some sort of modifier, such as the oblique marker or the locative marker. There is no such restriction on postverbal adverbs.\n\n2.5.1.1 Manner adverbs",

Bauman (1974), Michailovsky (1974) and DeLancey (1983). Mizo is no exception and I will deal very briefly with some of the verb morphology.\nTo start with, it will be useful to set up some criteria for distinguishing between particles, clitics and affixes. Zwicky (1985) has given some useful guidelines. For the time being I will distinguish between grammatical words and affixes as the latter are inflectional. Moreover, affixes",

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Jre naaul le? soo naaul soo3-n in mil veel\nthis child and that child DET-ERG ERG IACC hit This child and that child hit me.\n\n2.6.2.3 Oblique marker\nThe oblique marker also marks instruments. Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

These are some of the more important ones:\n\n2.6.1.1 Gender suffix\n\nAll proper names must have a gender suffix (see also section 2.3.2.4). The female gender suffix -i 1 and the male gender suffix -a are dropped in the vocative case, if the name is longer than two syllables. The vocative case is indicated by a low tone on the final syllable. For female names, the low tone of the vocative combines with the high tone of the affix so that the tone becomes a falling tone. Thus we get TONE CONTOURINGlO as in the case of determiners followed by ergative markers. (Tone contouring does not apply to male names because they are low tone in citation form.) Consider the following examples:\n\n(110) a. Maaml-a b. Maaml-aa c. Maaml-il d. Maaml-ii3 e. Maaml-boi?-a\n-EMT-MSUF\nf. Maam 1-boi?-i1\n-EMT-FSUF\ng. Maaml-boi?\n\nMama (boy's nickname) Mama!

(vocative)\n\n\f134 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\n2.6.1.2 Plural suffix\n\nPronouns are the only items marked for number. Each of the different types of pronouns have their own plural form. Thus, -nii3 is the plural marker for full pronouns, -n is the plural marker for subject pronoun clitics and -ng is the plural marker for the demonstrative pronouns. (See also section 2.3.1.1 and section 2.3.2.5.) For example:\n\n(111) a. kei2 ka :zaail lPRO lNOM sing I sing\n\nb. kei-nii3 ka-n\n\n:zaail\n\nlPRO-PL lNOM-PL sing\n\nwe sing\n\nc. ka zaail lNOM sing I sing\n\nd. ka-n\n\nzaai 1\n\nlNOM-PL sing\n\nwe sing\n\ne. hee noul hil DPRO cup DET this cup\n\nf. hee3-ng noul hiJ DPRO-PL cup DET these cups\n\nThe plural marker for the demonstrative pronoun is restricted to non-humans. Thus one cannot have:\n\n(112)\n\n*hee3-ng mii3 hil DPRO-PL cup DET these people\n\nInstead, the preferred form is:\n\n(113)\n\nhee mii3 tel hil DPRO person EX DET these people and such",

The rest of this section will describe the syntax of adverbial clauses in Mizo, classified according to their morphology: the degree o f finiteness of the verb in the adverbial clause and the subordinator. The instrumental case marker -jn (illustrated in Chapter III) functions as an adverbial subordinator. The locative case marker -a? appears less frequently. Inflected demonstratives such as cOan and khaan often function as subordinators. For instance, the inflected demonstrative cOan is the conditional subordinator 'if.' In most instances, if an inflected demonstrative is present, the instrumental case marker itself is optional.

I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes.

In the following section\n\nwe discuss the nature of the verbal reflexive in Mizo.\n\n7.2. Various Functions of the Verbal Reflexive\n\n✓ ■\n\n7.2.1. Self -benefactive (aatmanepada )\n\nThe aatmanepada self-benefactive marker in has the same form as- in ,the verbal reflexive in Mizo. When a third person pronoun occurs with the direct object it\n\n■ ^\nW*\n\n\frefers to somebody and not to Zova in sentence (15) . Hence, the occurrence of the self benefactive in is not permitted in such sentences. Notice that in sentence (14) in which there is no third person pronoun with the direct object self-benefactivein occurs. Fpr example:\n\n(14) (15)\n\nzova-0\n\nkut a - in\n\nsil\n\nZova ERG hands 3SG VR\n\nwash\n\n'Zova washed his(self's) hands.'\n\n*zova\ns.\nZova\n\na -kut a -in -sil his hand 3SG VR wash\n\n'Zova washed his hand.'\n\nWhen the self-benefactive occurs the ergative marker in in cannot occur with the subject (cf. sentences( 14)- (15) ). That is the self benefactive detransitivizes the verb just as a VR does. The absence of the ergative marker is indcated by 0 in (14). The presence of the self benefactive clearly indicates that the subject is the beneficiary of the action. Consider sentences (16) (17) and (18).\n\n(16) (17)\n\nzova-0 a - in- sil Zova ERG 3SG VR wash 'Zova is.washing himself.' zova-n a - sil Zova ERG 3SG wash\n\nx\n■\n\n\f(18)\n\n'Zova is washing (someone).' zova-0 a -in -bual zova ERG 3SG v r bath 'Zova is bathing.'\n\nNote that in (16) and (18), the VR occurs and Zova is the beneficiary of the action. Since the subject and the direct object are identical,there is no ergative marker with the subject. In (17), the beneficiary of the action is not identical to the subject, therefore, the ergative marker occurs.\nThe third person possessive pronoun may have the subject as its antecedent or may have arbitrary reference.Sentence (19) is illustrative:\n\n(19)",

                "content": "The grammar ofsimple clauses in Mizo 133\nhave a wide variety of phonological shapes and generally also have a wide variety of tones; cf. plural affixes. I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes. These are some of the more important ones:\n\n2.6.1.1 Gender suffix",

Their position is immediately following the adverbial particles (which can also mark aspect). Aspect markers relate an event to the time axis. They indicate if an event has happened yet, and if the event is completed or about to be completed. They also indicate how soon one can expect an event to take place and whether or not the event has been a long-awaited one. Several aspect markers have similar meanings with just shades of difference in their interpretation. Traditional grammarians have mistaken them for tense markers, even though their examples clearly show that Mizo does not mark tense (see Lorrain and Savidge (1898)). The following examples illustrate the versatility of aspect markers:\n\n(107) a. a\n\nkal.1 to?\n\n3NOM go PST/COMPL\n\n(S)he already left.\n\nb. a kal.1 taa3\n3NOM go at last (S)he has left at last.\n\nc. a kal.1 cia?

Because it is connected to a future event, it is often mistaken for a future tense marker. The examples below will demonstrate that it is different from the future tense marker for several reasons. For instance, it follows the negation\n\n\f132 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\nmarker whereas the future tense marker precedes it. The fact that they can both occur within the same phrase indicates that their functions are different\n\n(108) a. a\n\nkall ang2\n\n3NOM go MOD\n\n(S)he will go.\n\nb. a\n\nkall Jou ang2\n\n3NOM go NEG MOD\n\n(S)he will not go.\n\nc. a\n\nkall doonl Jou ang2\n\n3NOM go ASP NEG MOD\n\n(S)he will not be going.",

I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes.

Adverbs and direct object NPs are optional constituents of the VP just as in many other languages. The clitic pronoun, however, is required in every sentence (except for relative clauses, imperatives and subjectless wh-questions, cf. 3.4.1). Therefore, I assign it to a special level of the VP called V\". The remaining particles for mode, negation, aspect, etc. are optional again. So these can be dominated by a recursive V' constituent. A second and very persuasive argument that the pronoun clitics require their own V-bar constituent (here V\") is seen in the behaviour of the second person accusative pronoun clitic eel 'you', eel ul 'you (pl)', cf. example 51 below.\n(51) a. mi-sual2 in a manl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch 2ACC A criminal has caught you.\nb. mi-sual2 in a manl doonl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch ASP 2ACC A criminal is going to catch you.\nAt present I know of no tests to decide which of the two clitics is higher in the structure.

Morphology will be dealt with in greater detail in section 2.6.\n\n2.5.1 Adverbs\nAdverbs generally precede the main verb. Manner adverbs can follow the main verb under certain circumstances. The adverbs are manner adverbs, adverbs of time and adverbs of place. The last two adverbs are very similar. Adverbs that precede the verb require some sort of modifier, such as the oblique marker or the locative marker. There is no such restriction on postverbal adverbs.\n\n2.5.1.1 Manner adverbs",

Adverbs and direct object NPs are optional constituents of the VP just as in many other languages. The clitic pronoun, however, is required in every sentence (except for relative clauses, imperatives and subjectless wh-questions, cf. 3.4.1). Therefore, I assign it to a special level of the VP called V\". The remaining particles for mode, negation, aspect, etc. are optional again. So these can be dominated by a recursive V' constituent. A second and very persuasive argument that the pronoun clitics require their own V-bar constituent (here V\") is seen in the behaviour of the second person accusative pronoun clitic eel 'you', eel ul 'you (pl)', cf. example 51 below.\n(51) a. mi-sual2 in a manl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch 2ACC A criminal has caught you.\nb. mi-sual2 in a manl doonl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch ASP 2ACC A criminal is going to catch you.\nAt present I know of no tests to decide which of the two clitics is higher in the structure.

Morphology will be dealt with in greater detail in section 2.6.\n\n2.5.1 Adverbs\nAdverbs generally precede the main verb. Manner adverbs can follow the main verb under certain circumstances. The adverbs are manner adverbs, adverbs of time and adverbs of place. The last two adverbs are very similar. Adverbs that precede the verb require some sort of modifier, such as the oblique marker or the locative marker. There is no such restriction on postverbal adverbs.\n\n2.5.1.1 Manner adverbs",

Transitive sentences are distinguished from intransitive sentences by the ergative-absolutive case markers in the NP and nominative-accusative clitics on the VP.\nThe two types of questions, wh-questions and yes-no questions, were also examined. These two types of questions have different constructions. Wh-questions have both the wh word and the question word in the NP, where the wh word replaces the head noun in the NP. In contrast, yesno question words have the question word in the VP; yes-no question can also be stated in the negative. A further complication to the wh-question is the use of the Stem II verb form when the object is unknown. The only time a Stem I verb is used in a wh-question is when the object is known but the subject is not.\nThere are several types of imperatives, these along with optatives, hortatives and performatives have basically the same construction.\nMuch more work remains to be done on the syntax of complex sentences in Mizo. Hillard (1977) and Chhangte (1986) have considered the relative clause, and Chhangte (1986) has briefly discussed other clause types as well. Future work on Mizo syntax and phonology is planned by the author.\nNOTES\n1 Most of the data for this paper comes from my own experience as a native speaker. The sociolinguistic data was gathered during my brief visit to Mizoram (September to November 1986). It is based on chapters 3 and 4 of my thesis, Chhangte (1986).",

Moreover, the subject pronoun clitics are the same for both transitive and intransitive clauses.\nThe subject NP is obligatory for certain verbs.

Some sentences require an object. These are usually change-of-state verbs where the object either causes the change or is affected by the change. The object can be animate or inanimate. Thus, consider:\n\n(30) a. ui al vo-Jhum\ndog 3NOM beat-dead (S)he beat a dog to death.\n\nb. ceml al taat3-rhiaaml knife 3NOM sharpen-sharp (S)he sharpened the knife.\n\nc. tuil a? al\n\ntla-lhum\n\nwater LOC 3NOM fall-dead\n\n(S)he fell in the water and died (drowned).",

It goes without saying that, for this particular aspect of phonological theory, I have been greatly influenced by concepts like the core:periphery distinction of the Prague School and the Prosodic Approach of the Firthian School.\nAd (4) :\nThe concept of rules holding a key position in generative theory must be subject to criticism as long as no further criteria are imposed re­ garding uncontrolled and unwarranted applications. Instead of applying criteria such as 'naturalness conditions' in phonology which, in its most ridiculous attempt, has amounted to counting symbols as sole indi­ cators of different degrees of complexity, I have developed a criterion which is based on plausibility considerations. The ’cost' with which the explanation by a rule is imputed, is, in my theoretical framework, immediately calculable by measuring the degree of plausibility with re­ ference to the explanatory value that is attached to every component of the morphophonological level. In this context, the reader may be re­ minded of the three kinds of possible concepts of measurement, viz., classificatory concepts (e.g., terms like warm, hot, cortd in measuring temperature), coi^ara^ve (or topological) concepts (e.g., terms like warmer than, as warm at , etc.), and metr^a1, that is, purety quantitarive, concepts ^.g. 20 degaees cent^rade} . The ^onoh^ca1 compo­ nents as introduced in this essay have been conceived as comparative terms.\nThroughout the book, phonetic forms have been put between square brackets in accordance with the conventions established by the Interna­ tional Phonetic Association (revised Inbernationot Phanetze Alphabet of 1951).\nThe translation of Lushai words has been taken over literally from\nIx",

The question of what constitutes the phonological core and what the phonological pe­ riphery4 is inextricably associated with the question of morpheme classes and their semantic content. It can be shown for Lushai that all morphemes having /CVP/ or /CV?/ monosyllables with high tone height, whether bound expressives or free verbs, contain an intrinsic element of semantic expressiveness manifesting itself in high tone realization; the extrinsic element of semantic expressiveness is a purely phonetic phe­ nomenon facultatively manifesting itself in falsetto head voice. With regard to the aspect of communicative relevance, it should be pointed out that notoriously expressive features manifesting themselves either on tine levels of language competence or language {performance are apt to arouse a speaker's criti’cal awareness of Line existence of different structural \"layers within tine phonemic/phoneti‘c system of his mother tongue; a structural description ai’med at achieving tescri’pttve adequacy ought to take into account such lwgu^ti’c behavi'our.\nIn order to show in which respect my approach differs from the clas­ sical Prague . school concept of the core : periphery dichotomy (which is more in the realm of analysis of single phonemes or single phonological substructures), I quote a statement by Vachek (19(57:81):",

We have noticed that the occurrence of the negative lou is obligatory when the negative adverbs jsuch as never. neither, or negative quantifiers such as nobody.Ihbthinq occur in a sentence,We also noticed- that that the intensifier tak'very’ has three negative polarity items and their occurrence depends upon the nature of\n\n)\n\n\fthe adjective.\n\ni\n\nl.\n\nIt is interesting to note a language such as Telugu has\n\ntwo negatives leedu and kaadu where leedu is the negative\n\nform of the existential form of verb b£. and kaadu is the negative form of nonexistential verb bg.

Other important morphological categories include demonstrative pronouns, emphatic particles and numerical expressions. These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses. This chapter will discuss the morphological categories pertaining to noun phrases.\nCase marking will be dealt w ith first, followed by a discussion o f pronominal paradigms. Noun modifiers and quantifiers follow n ex t The last section illustrates lexical nominalization.\n\nCase Marking\n\nIn a simple declarative clause the case markers are: -in ergative, -m instrumental/adverbial and -a? locative. Absolutives are unmarked. Genitives are marked\n\nby high tone and vocative by a low tone. The following examples are illustrative.\n\n( l) a . keel-in nhim a-pet goat-ERG grass 3s-graze 'A/the goat is eating/grazing grass.'\n\nb. khool-m-\n\npuin ka-thfly\n\nmachine-INSTR cloth ls-sew\n\n'I am sewing with a machine.'\n\nc. kdn-huan-a?\n\nkeel a-lhht\n\nls.pl-garden-LOC goat 3s-enter\n\n'A/the goat entered our garden.'\n\n\fErgative\n\nLike many languages of this area, Mizo is an ergative language. The ergative\n\nsuffix -in marks all transitive subjects, regardless of their semantic role.\n\n(2) a. ka-nbu-m\n\nmin-vua\n\nlPoss-mother-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My mother beat me.'\n\nb. ka-nhit\n\nle? ka-p^a-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nlPoss-m otherand lPoss-father-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My m other and my father beat me.'\n\nc. ka-p&a-in\n\nloom=man a-doq\n\nlPoss-father-ERG prize\n\n3s-receive\n\n'My father received a prize.'\n\nInstrumental/Adverbial\n\nThe instrumental case marker is -in. It also functions as an adverbializer.\n\n(3) a. Kim-&n\n\ntiaq-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nKim-MASC.ERG stick-INSTR lo-beat\n\nTGma hit me with a stick.'\n\nb.

We have noticed that the occurrence of the negative lou is obligatory when the negative adverbs jsuch as never. neither, or negative quantifiers such as nobody.Ihbthinq occur in a sentence,We also noticed- that that the intensifier tak'very’ has three negative polarity items and their occurrence depends upon the nature of\n\n)\n\n\fthe adjective.\n\ni\n\nl.\n\nIt is interesting to note a language such as Telugu has\n\ntwo negatives leedu and kaadu where leedu is the negative\n\nform of the existential form of verb b£. and kaadu is the negative form of nonexistential verb bg.

Verb be carries tense and exhibits agreement with the derived subject. In type (B), the: verb is nominalized too but the verb tuku 'become' is added and iithis too exhibits agreement with the\nderived subject.\ni\nThe Juxtaposition strategy of the Mizo passive discussed above shares the following characteristics with the Quechua passive in type (B) above.\n\n(i) The original verb is nonfinite in both the cases.\n\n\fV / f \"■>\n0/C!% 1 'i’■\n0 ( )\n■0\n1 j\n■Q\n<\"V ( l b' Q .r*\n6'\nO'\no (3 0\n0\no ■ ii o, / \\\n6\"\n0\n0 \\\n()\n0\no\nb\no f >\n£ \\Q / 0 V XX\n0\n\\f V1\no o\no\n\n(ii) An extra verb be/become is added and this exhibits agreement with the derived subject.\no\n(iii) There is no linker linking the original verb and the newly added verb be.\n\nIn this section, we have presented an analysis of the passive of the older generation and that of the younger generation.

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Jre naaul le? soo naaul soo3-n in mil veel\nthis child and that child DET-ERG ERG IACC hit This child and that child hit me.\n\n2.6.2.3 Oblique marker\nThe oblique marker also marks instruments. Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

In these types there are no conjunctions but there may be an intervening nominal and one o f the verbs is semantically bleached. Foley and Olson claim that the two verbs represent one and only one event since one o f the verbs has a different meaning when it occurs in isolation. In other words, since the meaning of the serial verb construction is not equal to the sum of the meanings of the verbs in independent clauses, serial verbs cannot be derived transformationally from multi-clausal sources.\nMatisoff (1969) describes one of the more extreme cases of serialization in Lahu, a Tibeto-Burman language. Lahujuxtaposes several verbs with no intervening morpheme but Matisoff claims that 'one of the verbs is the logical head. The others stand in some sort of subordinate relationship to the head.’ M atisoff uses the term 'verb concatenation' to describe Lahu serialization, which he suggests involves subordination in some cases.\nMizo seems to be more similar to the Misumalpan languages described by Hale than to the serializing languages ofAfrica and Papua New Guinea. Moreover, unlike Southeast Asian languages such as Lahu, Mizo does not allow a seemingly endless string o f verb concatenations.

Under the nominalization hypothesis, the active sentence is nominalized and a new sentence node is created ( by Chomsky adjunction) with ni 'be' as the higher verb. The logical object 'raises' to the position of the subject of the'newly created sentence and the verb nl 'be' exhibits agreement with the new. subject. Since it is a case of raising, the focus marker su is attached to the raised noun phrase. The absence of the ergative marker, the agreement marker on the original verb and the nonfinite nature of the original verb can be explained as a result of nominalization. The nonavailability of a second pattern, namely, the pattern in which the original subject has an ergative marker and the original verb has an agreement marker with the verb in Juxtaposed passives strengthens the nominalization hypothesis.\n' Though the passive analysis and the nominalization analysis both seem to bej equally ■plausible, nominalization does not require fronting of the logical object since fronting Of the\ni\nlogical object is a strategy used by the older generation, the\n1 \\&",

In the first type, the embedded subject carries the ergative marker and the embedded verb carries the agreement marker. In the second type, the ergative marker as well as the agreement marker both are absent.

The logic of quantification in Mizo is more involved and it will be discussed separately in section 3.1.2. See also Lehman (1979b).\n\n2.3.5.1 Numeral quantifiers\nUnlike most other south-east Asian languages, Mizo does not have a semantically based system of noun classifiers, cf. Lehman (1979a). The numbering system, however, does display a · system of classifiers where the unit classifier is pa-, (as suggested by Lehman in personal communications). The classifiers for tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. are soom, zaa, saang2, respectively.

Only the deictic motion particles and the reciprocal/reflexive marker can come between it and the verb. See also section 2.3.2.5 for full form pronouns and pronoun clitics in NPs. The influence of cases to produce the different types of pronoun clitics, i.e., the nominative and accusative forms, will be discussed in section 2.5.4.2.\n\nThese, then, are some examples of pronoun clitics.\n\n(62) a. ka kall b. i kall c. akall d. ka-n kall e. i-n kal I f. a-n kal 1\n\nI go you go (s)he goes we go you (pl) go they go\n\n2.5.3 Deictic motion particles\nOne of the characteristics of TB languages is the deictic motion verbs (DeLancey 1985c). In Mizo, these are not verbs but preverbal particles which I call deictic motion particles (DMP). . The DMPs cliticise before main verb stems and cause the verbal complex to receive an interpretation of the subject's carrying out the action in a certain manner involving locomotion. In all instances it is the individual expressed by the pronoun, which immediately precedes the DMP, that moves.\nThe DMPs are limited to five lexical items: va 1 'away from the speaker'; rom 'towards addressee' in questions when the questioner is the subject and 'towards speaker' in all other cases; lou2 'toward speaker'; ham2 'up and away from speaker'; and zuk 'down and away from speaker'. These will also agree semantically with the demonstrative pronoun and determiner on NPs, i.e.\n(63) a. khiJ-ta? khi-anl han kall ro? up there DET-OBLQ up there go Hv1P Go up there!\n\n\fThe grammar of simple clauses in Mizo 119\n\nb. he 1-Jam I a? hi-an 1 ron son3 ro? this-side LOC DET-OBLQ hither move IMP Move it hither.\nc. kal ron da? doonl em2 nii lNOM thither put ASP Q be Should I (bring it and) put it there?",

Clitics are obligatory in certain constructions whereas particles are not.\n\n2.6.2.l Pronoun clitics\nAs mentioned earlier, pronoun clitics are tightly bound to whatever they precede. There are only three types in the noun phrase (see section 2.3.2.5) whereas in the verb phrase there are two more besides these: the prefixed first person accusative marker and the suffixed second person accusative marker. The following examples will demonstrate how the different forms are used in a transitive clause.\nThe subject pronoun clitics in an intransitive clause are as follows:\n(129) a. poonl a? kal chuak3 outside LOC lNOM exit I went outside.\nb. poonl a? ii chuak3 outside LOC 2NOM exit You went outside.\nc. poonl a? al chuak3 outside LOC 3NOM leave (S)he went outside\n\n\f140 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\nThe pronoun clitics for objects are as follows:\n\n(130) a. aarl in mi 1 cuk hen ERG lACC peck A hen pecked me.\n\nb. aarl in al cuk eel hen ERG 3NOM peck 2ACC A hen pecked you.\n\nc. aarl in al cuk ~ hen ERG 3NOM peck 3ACC A hen pecked (her/him/it).\n\nPlural forms of the pronoun clitics are as follows:\n\n(131) a. aarJ-rual in a2-n\n\ncuk flJ\n\nhen-flock ERG 3NOM-PL peck 3ACC\n\nA flock of hens pecked it.\n\nb. aarJ in al\n\ncuk eel ul\n\nhen ERG 3NOM peck 2ACC PL\n\nA hens pecked you (pl).\n\nc. aarl in a2-n cuk eel ul hen ERG 3NOM-PL peck 2ACC PL (Several) hens pecked you (pl).\n\n2.6.2.2 Ergative marker",

Other important morphological categories include demonstrative pronouns, emphatic particles and numerical expressions. These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses.

Adjectives and Agreement\n\nAdjectives in Mizo that follow the noun (postnominal\n\nadjectives) d6 not exhibit agreement in number and person.\n\nThe following sentences are illustrative.(The adjectives are in\n\nbold)\n\n•\n\n(24) I .\n\nnimiri-ah leehkhabu tSa tak ka\n\nyesterday book\n\ngood very 1SG\n\n'I read a very good book yesterday.'\n\n-chiaar read\n\n(25)\n\nvOin^ah hmeichenaupang hmeltSa ka -hmu\n\ntoday girl\n\nbeautiful 1SG meet\n\n\fO n (/'as\"•\n0 O'\nO 0 O O\no-\no O o' 0\no.\nir a, o,\niV O'\nV •o\n1 'i c.r\nQ) O <y a\nPo,\no' o\no/Ss,\nO'\nV O'\n0 o o' ■u o o\nU LJ\no\n0 / \\\n\n■\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe future tense marker -ang occurs to the right of the\n\nadjective.\n\n4.4.

Section 7 deals\n\nwith agreement1 in conditional clauses. Section 8 discusses some\n\ncases in which the absence of agreement marker necessitates the\n\npresence of a' possessive pronoun and how such presence can be\n\nneatly explained by the principle of recoverability of deletion.\n\nIn the last section, we discuss the complementary distribution of\n\nthe agreement markers in predicative adjectives and verb\n\n.\n\n\f4.1.1. Ergativity and Agreement The first, second and third person subject pronominal\nclitics are given below.\n\nPERSON\nFIRST PERSON SECOND PERSON THIRD PERSON\n\nSINGULAR\nkai a-\n\nPLURAL\nkaninan-\n\nWhen the verb is intransitive, the verb agrees in number and person with the SUBJECT. The agreement marker occurs to the LEFT of the verb and has the same form with the possessive pronoun. Mizo is a strong pro drop language and thus subject and object and indirect object pronouns do not normally occur overtly. The following sentences are illustrative\n\n(1)\n\nka - kal - ang\n\n1SG\n\ngo\n\nFUT\n\n'I will go.

Though the patient is not overtly present, the agreement in number and person is coded in the verb. In contrast,in a language such as Hindi- Urdu, the agreement marker of the patient is not coded in the verb unless the patient is overtly present. The reason as to why subject, or direct object pronouns need not overtly be present in Mizo is due to the rich coding of the pronominal markers in the verb (see the chapter 4 on Agreement for further details).\n\n5.2.2. Number Agreement in Ergative Sentences\n\nAnother point .worth mentioning here concerns the number agreement marker in ergative sentences. In sentence (6), (repeated here1for convenience, as sentence (8), min, the first person object agreement marker could express either singular or plural.\n\n(8)\n\nzova-n min- hmu\n\nZova ERG 1SG/.PL see\n\nOAM 1\n\n'Zova saw me/us.'\n\nHowever, some speakers have two distinct forms mi for singular and min for plural as object agreement markers in ergative constructions. For example:\n\n(9)\n\nlaali-n\n\nmi - hria\n\nj\n\n18\n\nj\n\n3\n\nj\n\ni\n\n\fLali ERG 1SG know\n\nOAM\n\n’Lali knows me.’\n\n(10)\n\nTluaangi-n\n\nbazaar -ah min-\n\nhmu -ang\n\nTluangi ERG market\n\nin 1SG/PL meet FUT\n\n'Tluangi will meet us in the market.'\n\nWhen object is in the second person, ££ is the agreement marker in singular and ceu in plural for all the speakers of\n\nMizo. The agreement marker occurs to the right of the verb\n\nand the tense marker. For example:\n\n(1 1 )\n\nzovi-n\n\na -that- ang - ce\n\nZovi ERG 3SG kill FUT 2SG OAM\n\n'Zovi will kill you (SG). .'\n\n( 12)\n\nlaali - in a -that- ang - ce-u\n\nLali\n\nERG 3SG kill FUT\n\n2PL OAM\n\n'Lali will kill you(PL)'.",

Cases Involving the Absence of Agreement Marker\n\nThere are cases in which the agreement marker does not\n\novertly occur in Mizo. These include : Wh- questions (4.5.1.\n\nbelow), the cases which involve either deletion or movement of\n\nthe\n\nembedded\n\nsubject\n\n(4.5.2,-6.)\n\nbelow)\n\nand\n\nimperatives(4.5.7.below ).\n\n4;5.1.

We will also discuss\n\nthe nature of agreement involved in split ergative constructions.\n\nWe will present data which show how the agreement marker and\n\nthe ergative marker together are either present or absent in\n\nrelative clauses and passives. This chapter is organized, as follows:\n\nSection 1 deals with the split ergative construction in Mizo.\n\nSection 2 is concerned with subject-verb agreement manifested\n\nin terms of person and number and also agreement between\n\ndemonstrative pronouns and nouns. Section 3 contains the agreement\n\nexhibited in predicative adjectives. Section 4 discusses the role\n\nof the feature animacy in verb agreement.

These are some of the more important ones:\n\n2.6.1.1 Gender suffix\n\nAll proper names must have a gender suffix (see also section 2.3.2.4). The female gender suffix -i 1 and the male gender suffix -a are dropped in the vocative case, if the name is longer than two syllables. The vocative case is indicated by a low tone on the final syllable. For female names, the low tone of the vocative combines with the high tone of the affix so that the tone becomes a falling tone. Thus we get TONE CONTOURINGlO as in the case of determiners followed by ergative markers. (Tone contouring does not apply to male names because they are low tone in citation form.) Consider the following examples:\n\n(110) a. Maaml-a b. Maaml-aa c. Maaml-il d. Maaml-ii3 e. Maaml-boi?-a\n-EMT-MSUF\nf. Maam 1-boi?-i1\n-EMT-FSUF\ng. Maaml-boi?\n\nMama (boy's nickname) Mama! (vocative) Marni (girl's nickname) Marni! (vocative) Mambawiha (usually firstbom son)\nMambawihi\nMambawih! (vocative)\n\n\f134 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\n2.6.1.2 Plural suffix\n\nPronouns are the only items marked for number. Each of the different types of pronouns have their own plural form. Thus, -nii3 is the plural marker for full pronouns, -n is the plural marker for subject pronoun clitics and -ng is the plural marker for the demonstrative pronouns. (See also section 2.3.1.1 and section 2.3.2.5.) For example:\n\n(111) a. kei2 ka :zaail lPRO lNOM sing I sing\n\nb. kei-nii3 ka-n\n\n:zaail\n\nlPRO-PL lNOM-PL sing\n\nwe sing\n\nc. ka zaail lNOM sing I sing\n\nd. ka-n\n\nzaai 1\n\nlNOM-PL sing\n\nwe sing\n\ne. hee noul hil DPRO cup DET this cup\n\nf. hee3-ng noul hiJ DPRO-PL cup DET these cups\n\nThe plural marker for the demonstrative pronoun is restricted to non-humans. Thus one cannot have:\n\n(112)\n\n*hee3-ng mii3 hil DPRO-PL cup DET these people\n\nInstead, the preferred form is:\n\n(113)\n\nhee mii3 tel hil DPRO person EX DET these people and such",

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Jre naaul le? soo naaul soo3-n in mil veel\nthis child and that child DET-ERG ERG IACC hit This child and that child hit me.\n\n2.6.2.3 Oblique marker\nThe oblique marker also marks instruments. Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes.

Other important morphological categories include demonstrative pronouns, emphatic particles and numerical expressions. These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses. This chapter will discuss the morphological categories pertaining to noun phrases.\nCase marking will be dealt w ith first, followed by a discussion o f pronominal paradigms. Noun modifiers and quantifiers follow n ex t The last section illustrates lexical nominalization.\n\nCase Marking\n\nIn a simple declarative clause the case markers are: -in ergative, -m instrumental/adverbial and -a? locative. Absolutives are unmarked. Genitives are marked\n\nby high tone and vocative by a low tone. The following examples are illustrative.\n\n( l) a . keel-in nhim a-pet goat-ERG grass 3s-graze 'A/the goat is eating/grazing grass.'\n\nb. khool-m-\n\npuin ka-thfly\n\nmachine-INSTR cloth ls-sew\n\n'I am sewing with a machine.'\n\nc. kdn-huan-a?\n\nkeel a-lhht\n\nls.pl-garden-LOC goat 3s-enter\n\n'A/the goat entered our garden.'\n\n\fErgative\n\nLike many languages of this area, Mizo is an ergative language. The ergative\n\nsuffix -in marks all transitive subjects, regardless of their semantic role.\n\n(2) a. ka-nbu-m\n\nmin-vua\n\nlPoss-mother-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My mother beat me.'\n\nb. ka-nhit\n\nle? ka-p^a-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nlPoss-m otherand lPoss-father-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My m other and my father beat me.'\n\nc. ka-p&a-in\n\nloom=man a-doq\n\nlPoss-father-ERG prize\n\n3s-receive\n\n'My father received a prize.'\n\nInstrumental/Adverbial\n\nThe instrumental case marker is -in. It also functions as an adverbializer.\n\n(3) a. Kim-&n\n\ntiaq-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nKim-MASC.ERG stick-INSTR lo-beat\n\nTGma hit me with a stick.'\n\nb.

These are some of the more important ones:\n\n2.6.1.1 Gender suffix\n\nAll proper names must have a gender suffix (see also section 2.3.2.4). The female gender suffix -i 1 and the male gender suffix -a are dropped in the vocative case, if the name is longer than two syllables. The vocative case is indicated by a low tone on the final syllable. For female names, the low tone of the vocative combines with the high tone of the affix so that the tone becomes a falling tone. Thus we get TONE CONTOURINGlO as in the case of determiners followed by ergative markers. (Tone contouring does not apply to male names because they are low tone in citation form.)

Other important morphological categories include demonstrative pronouns, emphatic particles and numerical expressions. These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses. This chapter will discuss the morphological categories pertaining to noun phrases.\nCase marking will be dealt w ith first, followed by a discussion o f pronominal paradigms. Noun modifiers and quantifiers follow n ex t The last section illustrates lexical nominalization.\n\nCase Marking\n\nIn a simple declarative clause the case markers are: -in ergative, -m instrumental/adverbial and -a? locative. Absolutives are unmarked. Genitives are marked\n\nby high tone and vocative by a low tone. The following examples are illustrative.\n\n( l) a . keel-in nhim a-pet goat-ERG grass 3s-graze 'A/the goat is eating/grazing grass.'\n\nb. khool-m-\n\npuin ka-thfly\n\nmachine-INSTR cloth ls-sew\n\n'I am sewing with a machine.'\n\nc. kdn-huan-a?\n\nkeel a-lhht\n\nls.pl-garden-LOC goat 3s-enter\n\n'A/the goat entered our garden.'\n\n\fErgative\n\nLike many languages of this area, Mizo is an ergative language. The ergative\n\nsuffix -in marks all transitive subjects, regardless of their semantic role.\n\n(2) a. ka-nbu-m\n\nmin-vua\n\nlPoss-mother-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My mother beat me.'\n\nb. ka-nhit\n\nle? ka-p^a-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nlPoss-m otherand lPoss-father-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My m other and my father beat me.'\n\nc. ka-p&a-in\n\nloom=man a-doq\n\nlPoss-father-ERG prize\n\n3s-receive\n\n'My father received a prize.'\n\nInstrumental/Adverbial\n\nThe instrumental case marker is -in.

The more common NP quantifiers are: zong zong3 'each and every', trhen 1 khat 'some (of the whole)', vaai2 'all/everything', zaa 'all/every', tam2 tak 'several, many', deem2 tee2 'very few' and tin3 'each' (refer to section 2.6.3.3 for VP quantifiers). See also section 2.6.1.2 for plural markers.\nThese are examples of NP quantifiers:\n\n(47) a. aarl zong zong3 hen all all the hens\n\nb. aarl tam2 tak hen many INT many hens\n\nc. aarl deem 1 te2 hen few little few hens\n\nd. aarl hou3 hen group group of hens\n\ne. a2-n vaai2 inl a-n kall 3P-PL all OBLQ 3NOM-PL went they all went\n\nf. mii3 zong zong3 a-n kall\n\npeople all\n\n3NOM-PL went\n\nall the people went\n\ng. mi tin3 a-n kal 1 person each 3NOM-PL go each person went\n\nh. an-nii3 hou3 a-n kal 1 3PRO-PL group 3NOM-PL go they went (together)\n\ni. an hou3 te 1 a-n kal 1\n3P PL group EX 3NOM-PL go their party went\n\n\f112 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\n2.3.5.3 Plurality\nNumber is indicated either by morphology or by cardinal numbers. There is another optional plural particle, tel. When it occurs without the other number markers, tel has a slightly different meaning. In this instance, tel does not signify 'several of the specified item' but rather, 'the specified item plus others associated with it'. Compare the following examples:\n\n(48) a. kal nuu3 tel kal paa3 tel IP mother EX IP father EX my mother, father, etc.\n\nb. ka Juul tel kal cal\n\ntel\n\nIP head EX IP forehead EX\n\nmy head, forehead, etc.\n\nThe above examples clearly show that the particle te 1 does not indicate plurality even though it indicates a collection of subjects. Its true contribution, however, more resembles English etc. which indicates that the overt forms are merely examples of a longer list. Therefore, it is understandable that te 1 occurs in plural NPs, as the listed forms may only be indicative of a larger set, e.g.",

When it does occur, quantification is preceded by all the other constituents within the NP, except for the determiner and the case marker.

The logic of quantification in Mizo is more involved and it will be discussed separately in section 3.1.2. See also Lehman (1979b).\n\n2.3.5.1 Numeral quantifiers\nUnlike most other south-east Asian languages, Mizo does not have a semantically based system of noun classifiers, cf. Lehman (1979a). The numbering system, however, does display a · system of classifiers where the unit classifier is pa-, (as suggested by Lehman in personal communications). The classifiers for tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. are soom, zaa, saang2, respectively. The numbering system is decimal, as shown below:\n\n(39) a. pa-khat\n\none\n\nb. pa-nhi?\n\ntwo\n\nc. pa-thuml three\n\nd. pa-1iil\n\nfour\n\ne. pa-ngaa 1 five\n\nf. pa-ruk g. pa-sa-ri? h. pa-riat3 1. pa-kua2 J. soom\n\nsix seven eight nine ten\n\n\fThe grammar ofsimple clauses in Mizo 109",

It also appears that genitival- of constructions in Mizo are marked with what I call the relativiser, -al. In most instances it coalesces with the preceding segment so that only the high tone remains. This same relativiser shows up in relative clause constructions.\n(33) a.

Ihangl-kuurl-al puul ui2 -MSUF-REL master dog\nThangkura's master's dog\nIf the possessed item is not specified, the word taa3, meaning 'owned; possessed' is used in place of the noun.\n(34) a. Ihang1-kuur1-a1 taa3 -MSUF-REL own\nThangkura's own\nb. ka taa3 lP own my own\nThe word taa3 has often been mistaken for the possessor word.

The more common NP quantifiers are: zong zong3 'each and every', trhen 1 khat 'some (of the whole)', vaai2 'all/everything', zaa 'all/every', tam2 tak 'several, many', deem2 tee2 'very few' and tin3 'each' (refer to section 2.6.3.3 for VP quantifiers). See also section 2.6.1.2 for plural markers.\nThese are examples of NP quantifiers:\n\n(47) a. aarl zong zong3 hen all all the hens\n\nb. aarl tam2 tak hen many INT many hens\n\nc. aarl deem 1 te2 hen few little few hens\n\nd. aarl hou3 hen group group of hens\n\ne. a2-n vaai2 inl a-n kall 3P-PL all OBLQ 3NOM-PL went they all went\n\nf. mii3 zong zong3 a-n kall\n\npeople all\n\n3NOM-PL went\n\nall the people went\n\ng. mi tin3 a-n kal 1 person each 3NOM-PL go each person went\n\nh. an-nii3 hou3 a-n kal 1 3PRO-PL group 3NOM-PL go they went (together)\n\ni. an hou3 te 1 a-n kal 1\n3P PL group EX 3NOM-PL go their party went\n\n\f112 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\n2.3.5.3 Plurality\nNumber is indicated either by morphology or by cardinal numbers. There is another optional plural particle, tel. When it occurs without the other number markers, tel has a slightly different meaning. In this instance, tel does not signify 'several of the specified item' but rather, 'the specified item plus others associated with it'. Compare the following examples:\n\n(48) a. kal nuu3 tel kal paa3 tel IP mother EX IP father EX my mother, father, etc.\n\nb. ka Juul tel kal cal\n\ntel\n\nIP head EX IP forehead EX\n\nmy head, forehead, etc.\n\nThe above examples clearly show that the particle te 1 does not indicate plurality even though it indicates a collection of subjects. Its true contribution, however, more resembles English etc. which indicates that the overt forms are merely examples of a longer list. Therefore, it is understandable that te 1 occurs in plural NPs, as the listed forms may only be indicative of a larger set, e.g.",

                "content": "2.6.3.3 Quantifying particles\n\nQuantifying particles can occur both in the noun phrase and the verb phrase. The most important ones in the noun phrase were shown in section 2.3.5.2. Those in the verb phrase are modal in character and are postverbal. It is usually not necessary to have quantifying particles in both noun phrase and verb phrase.\n\nThe examples below will show the difference between the two types.\n\n(141) a. .ka aarl zong zong3 mil lei. sak.\n\nIP hen\n\nall\n\nIACC buyII BEN\n\n(S)he bought all my hens for/from me.\n\nb. .ka aarl min2 lei sak. vek1 IP hen IACC buyII BEN all (S)he bought all my hens for/from me.\n\n\f144 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\nc. aarl tam2 tak .a lei2 hen many INT 3NOM bought (S)he bought several hens.\n\nd. aarl a lei treu'l 1 hen 3NOM buy many (S)he bought several hens.\n\ne. a2-n\n\nvaai2 inl\n\na-n\n\nchuak3\n\n3PRO-PL all OBLQ 3NOM-PL exit\n\nThey all left.\n\nf. a-n\n\nchuak3 vek 1\n\n3NOM-PL exit all\n\nThey all left.\n\nThus, from the above it appears as though the quantifiers in both the noun phrase and the verb phrase have similar meanings. However, there are fewer types of quantifiers in the verb phrase. The postverbal quantifiers also seem to express degree, besides quantity. They are used mostly for uncountable items whereas the quantifiers in the noun phrase are usually countable.\n\nCompare the following examples:\n\n(142) a. voi3 tam2 tak mil vuaa times many INT lACC beat (S)he beat me several times.\n\nb. mil m rhep 1 lACC beat severely (S)he gave me a severe beating.\n\n2.6.3.4 Intensifiers\n\nIntensifiers generally follow a general quantifier or an adjective, as in:\n\n(143) a. pang-paarl t.am2 tak ka lei2\n\nflower\n\nmany INT lNOM buy\n\nI bought many flowers.\n\nb. pang-paarl mooil tak kE.1 mhuu\n\nflower\n\npretty INT lNOM see\n\nI saw a very beautiful flower.\n\nc. pang-paarl mooil em3 em3 kE.1 mhuu\n\nflower\n\npretty INT INOM see\n\nI saw a very, very beautiful flower.\n\n\fThe grammar of simple clauses in Miw 145\n\nd. pang-paarl maoil luJ-tuk kal mhuu\n\nflower\n\npretty INT lNOM see",

Particles are usually low in content but high in function, especially in conveying the attitude of the speaker. Some particles are obligatory, depending on the context, but they are usually optional.\n\n2.6.3.1 Demonstrative pronouns and determiners\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the demonstrative pronoun and the determiner agree in deictic degree. Refer to sections 2.3.1, 2.3.1.1, 2.3.1.2, 2.3.1.3, 2.6.1.2 and 2.6.1.4 for demonstrative pronoun and determiner morphologies. See also Benedict (1983).

When it does occur, quantification is preceded by all the other constituents within the NP, except for the determiner and the case marker. Unlike qualifiers, quantifiers show a much more rigid word order:\n\n(38)\n\nQnP\n\nQ~EX\n\n~I\n\nNum'\n\nQn\n\ntel\n\n~\n\nek.\n\nCLF Num\n\nI\n\npa\n\nkua 2\n\nI .I\nunit mne\n\nhou3\nI\ngroup\n\n'group of nine and such'\n\nThe quantifiers in the NP agree in number with the subject pronoun clitics in the VP. The logic of quantification in Mizo is more involved and it will be discussed separately in section 3.1.2. See also Lehman (1979b).\n\n2.3.5.1 Numeral quantifiers\nUnlike most other south-east Asian languages, Mizo does not have a semantically based system of noun classifiers, cf. Lehman (1979a). The numbering system, however, does display a · system of classifiers where the unit classifier is pa-, (as suggested by Lehman in personal communications). The classifiers for tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. are soom, zaa, saang2, respectively. The numbering system is decimal, as shown below:\n\n(39) a. pa-khat\n\none\n\nb. pa-nhi?\n\ntwo\n\nc. pa-thuml three\n\nd. pa-1iil\n\nfour\n\ne. pa-ngaa 1 five\n\nf. pa-ruk g. pa-sa-ri? h. pa-riat3 1. pa-kua2 J. soom\n\nsix seven eight nine ten\n\n\fThe grammar ofsimple clauses in Mizo 109",

The answer to this can be given in terms of the notion of recoverability.\nSince there is no agreement marker on the verb, the subject noun phrase of the embedded sentence cannot be recovered. The possessive pronoun on the object noun phrase provides the information concerning the subject of the embedded clause. Thus, the plural marker an can occur either with the verb or with the object which is relativized. However, both the types of agreement patterns indicate the number, and person of the subject only.

Furthermore, since headed relative clauses are rare, examples of\n\nrelative clauses in M izo are rare.\n\nSentential Complementation\n\nAccording to Noonan (1985) sentential complementation (hereafter complementation) is 'the syntactic situation that arises when a notional sentence or predication is an argument of a predicate.' Givdn (1990) expands this further to say that sentential complements are 'propositions functioning in the role of either subject or object argument of the verb.' Thus in a discussion of complementation in a language it is necessary to distinguish syntactic properties of subjects and objects. The purpose of this section then is to describe complementation in Mizo and examine some of the syntactic relationships between the matrix and complement clauses.4\nM izo has two basic complementation types. These can be identified by: a) the degree to which the complement clause is nominalized—this is reflected by the choice\nof verb stem in the complement clause.\n\n\f166 b) the morphological markers of complementation.\nThe complement types will be presented according to how finite the complement clause is. That is, the complement o f Type 1 has the most finite construction and the complement of Type 2 is the most nominalized (least finite). The morphological marker for each type will also be identified.\nThe subtypes are divided according to the morphological markers of complementation. Type 1.1, which is the most finite, does not have any complementizer. The rest have identifiable complementizers and these will be presented separately with examples.\n\nType 1: Finite Complement C auses\n\nComplement clauses o f cognition and utterance verbs such as know ,' 'think,'\n\n'believe' and 'say' are the most finite.

Being a tonal language there is very little variation in pitch, even in excited speech. An extra high falling pitch is sometimes used for emphasis. This, however, applies only to words with high tone.\nThe way intonation affects a word depends on w hether or not it is in a major word class. For instance, the quantifying particle zon zon can also be pronounced zon zdn. In comparision, a low tone lexical verb such as tji ’to do' can also take on falling intonation when stressed. However, Mizo culture does not tolerate stressing o f lexical words and a person who stresses too many words is considered to be lacking in patience.\nThe greatest change in Mizo phonology has come in the change o f tempo. A slow, deliberate pace used to be the norm. Nowadays, the children in high school rattle on at about four tim es the speed of their grandparents.\n\nPhonology and Morphology\n\nThe phonological processes described above are useful for resolving issues pertaining to morphology and syntax. These are as follows: 1. Affixes have their own peculiar tone sandhi rule: pronominal agreement prefixes\nundergo one type of tone change and derivational prefixes another type.\n\n\f2. The high glottal tone does not occur in m ajor word classes. 3. Intonation can raise the pitch of certain words. However, words with low tone are\nusually not affected if they belong to a major word class. The remainder of the thesis will focus on the syntax and morphology of Mizo",

Being a tonal language there is very little variation in pitch, even in excited speech. An extra high falling pitch is sometimes used for emphasis. This, however, applies only to words with high tone.\nThe way intonation affects a word depends on w hether or not it is in a major word class. For instance, the quantifying particle zon zon can also be pronounced zon zdn. In comparision, a low tone lexical verb such as tji ’to do' can also take on falling intonation when stressed. However, Mizo culture does not tolerate stressing o f lexical words and a person who stresses too many words is considered to be lacking in patience.\nThe greatest change in Mizo phonology has come in the change o f tempo. A slow, deliberate pace used to be the norm. Nowadays, the children in high school rattle on at about four tim es the speed of their grandparents.\n\nPhonology and Morphology\n\nThe phonological processes described above are useful for resolving issues pertaining to morphology and syntax. These are as follows: 1. Affixes have their own peculiar tone sandhi rule: pronominal agreement prefixes\nundergo one type of tone change and derivational prefixes another type.\n\n\f2. The high glottal tone does not occur in m ajor word classes. 3. Intonation can raise the pitch of certain words. However, words with low tone are\nusually not affected if they belong to a major word class. The remainder of the thesis will focus on the syntax and morphology of Mizo",

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

It also appears that genitival- of constructions in Mizo are marked with what I call the relativiser, -al. In most instances it coalesces with the preceding segment so that only the high tone remains. This same relativiser shows up in relative clause constructions.\n(33) a.

Other important morphological categories include demonstrative pronouns, emphatic particles and numerical expressions. These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses. This chapter will discuss the morphological categories pertaining to noun phrases.\nCase marking will be dealt w ith first, followed by a discussion o f pronominal paradigms. Noun modifiers and quantifiers follow n ex t The last section illustrates lexical nominalization.\n\nCase Marking\n\nIn a simple declarative clause the case markers are: -in ergative, -m instrumental/adverbial and -a? locative.

The question of what constitutes the phonological core and what the phonological pe­ riphery4 is inextricably associated with the question of morpheme classes and their semantic content. It can be shown for Lushai that all morphemes having /CVP/ or /CV?/ monosyllables with high tone height, whether bound expressives or free verbs, contain an intrinsic element of semantic expressiveness manifesting itself in high tone realization; the extrinsic element of semantic expressiveness is a purely phonetic phe­ nomenon facultatively manifesting itself in falsetto head voice. With regard to the aspect of communicative relevance, it should be pointed out that notoriously expressive features manifesting themselves either on tine levels of language competence or language {performance are apt to arouse a speaker's criti’cal awareness of Line existence of different structural \"layers within tine phonemic/phoneti‘c system of his mother tongue; a structural description ai’med at achieving tescri’pttve adequacy ought to take into account such lwgu^ti’c behavi'our.\nIn order to show in which respect my approach differs from the clas­ sical Prague . school concept of the core : periphery dichotomy (which is more in the realm of analysis of single phonemes or single phonological substructures), I quote a statement by Vachek (19(57:81):",

It goes without saying that, for this particular aspect of phonological theory, I have been greatly influenced by concepts like the core:periphery distinction of the Prague School and the Prosodic Approach of the Firthian School.\nAd (4) :\nThe concept of rules holding a key position in generative theory must be subject to criticism as long as no further criteria are imposed re­ garding uncontrolled and unwarranted applications. Instead of applying criteria such as 'naturalness conditions' in phonology which, in its most ridiculous attempt, has amounted to counting symbols as sole indi­ cators of different degrees of complexity, I have developed a criterion which is based on plausibility considerations. The ’cost' with which the explanation by a rule is imputed, is, in my theoretical framework, immediately calculable by measuring the degree of plausibility with re­ ference to the explanatory value that is attached to every component of the morphophonological level. In this context, the reader may be re­ minded of the three kinds of possible concepts of measurement, viz., classificatory concepts (e.g., terms like warm, hot, cortd in measuring temperature), coi^ara^ve (or topological) concepts (e.g., terms like warmer than, as warm at , etc.), and metr^a1, that is, purety quantitarive, concepts ^.g. 20 degaees cent^rade} . The ^onoh^ca1 compo­ nents as introduced in this essay have been conceived as comparative terms.\nThroughout the book, phonetic forms have been put between square brackets in accordance with the conventions established by the Interna­ tional Phonetic Association (revised Inbernationot Phanetze Alphabet of 1951).\nThe translation of Lushai words has been taken over literally from\nIx",

I have also added dependent verb stems to entries where there is a change in tone in the dependent stem (Lorrain did not marie tone so he did not have the entries).\n2. The phonemes /g/ and /]/ have been introduced within the last century through loan words (mainly Bible translation). However, those who are monolingual (a small minority) cannot pronounce /g/ and most M izos still substitute hJ for Ijl.\n3 .1have heard an alveopalatal fricative in the speech of some male, which may be why Lonain and Savidge (1898) at first represented it with 'sh.'\n4.

I don't know who Bright's main informant was. My dialect is title southern d ialect\n5. There is no phonetic motivation for this sound change so the reason remains a mystery. It is also a very strange occurrence considering that Mizos have always taken great pride in being able to pronounce /r/ unlike some o f their neighbors who do not contrast between lil and /r/. Some have suggested that the trend started from preachers trying to copy Americans. That all popular singers and people below thirty have difficulty with /r/ does suggest a sociological motivation. A s one man once commented wryly, \"These young people, they cannot flap their V when they speak M izo. Y et when they try to say an English word such as 'm otor' they trill all over the place!\"\n6. Henderson (1948) also analyzes them as consonants.\n7. Zahao has two level tones (high, low) and one contour tone (falling) whereas M izo has tw o level tones and two contour tones (falling, rising).

                "content": "The grammar ofsimple clauses in Mizo 133\nhave a wide variety of phonological shapes and generally also have a wide variety of tones; cf. plural affixes. I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes. These are some of the more important ones:\n\n2.6.1.1 Gender suffix",

Bauman (1974), Michailovsky (1974) and DeLancey (1983). Mizo is no exception and I will deal very briefly with some of the verb morphology.\nTo start with, it will be useful to set up some criteria for distinguishing between particles, clitics and affixes. Zwicky (1985) has given some useful guidelines. For the time being I will distinguish between grammatical words and affixes as the latter are inflectional. Moreover, affixes",

We have noticed that the occurrence of the negative lou is obligatory when the negative adverbs jsuch as never. neither, or negative quantifiers such as nobody.Ihbthinq occur in a sentence,We also noticed- that that the intensifier tak'very’ has three negative polarity items and their occurrence depends upon the nature of\n\n)\n\n\fthe adjective.\n\ni\n\nl.\n\nIt is interesting to note a language such as Telugu has\n\ntwo negatives leedu and kaadu where leedu is the negative\n\nform of the existential form of verb b£. and kaadu is the negative form of nonexistential verb bg.

In fact it is the coding of the plural marker that gives the reciprocal interpretation. -\n\n\fIt may be recalled that normally pronominal subjects do not overtly occur in Mizo, unless they are in the scope of an emphatic such as maah.

Further, native speakers of Mizo feel that sentences such as (13) and (14) are the passive equivalents of the English passive. We will therefore prefer to analyze examples such as (13) and (14) as passives.\nIn Imbabura Quechua (Hermon, 1984) too there are two types of passives. The following examples are illustrative:\n\nType A:\n\no •\n(15a)\n\n»\nnuka -ka juan maka-shke\n\nka-rks-ni\n\nI NOM' TOP Juan hit passive be PST l\n\n11 was hit by Juan.'\n\nType B :\n\n(15b)\n\nnuka -ka maka -y tuku -rka -ni\n\nI NOM TOP hit\n\nINF become PST\n\n1\n\n'I was hit. 1\n\nIn type (A), the verb is nominalized with the passive marker shka following the nominalized verb and verb be is added. Verb be carries tense and exhibits agreement with the derived subject. In type (B), the: verb is nominalized too but the verb tuku 'become' is added and iithis too exhibits agreement with the\nderived subject.\ni\nThe Juxtaposition strategy of the Mizo passive discussed above shares the following characteristics with the Quechua passive in type (B) above.\n\n(i) The original verb is nonfinite in both the cases.\n\n\fV / f \"■>\n0/C!% 1 'i’■\n0 ( )\n■0\n1 j\n■Q\n<\"V ( l b' Q .r*\n6'\nO'\no (3 0\n0\no ■ ii o, / \\\n6\"\n0\n0 \\\n()\n0\no\nb\no f >\n£ \\Q / 0 V XX\n0\n\\f V1\no o\no\n\n(ii) An extra verb be/become is added and this exhibits agreement with the derived subject.\no\n(iii) There is no linker linking the original verb and the newly added verb be.\n\nIn this section, we have presented an analysis of the passive of the older generation and that of the younger generation. We have also shown how the passive in Mizo shares features with the passive',; in Imbabura Quechua.\n\n8.3. The Position of the Passive Subject\n\nAnother interesting characteristic feature of the passive in\n\nMizo is that the derived subject, can occur either to the left\n\nas in (16a),(17a) or to the right of the original sentence as in\n\n(16b) and (17b).\n\n(16a)\n\nthei te cu [ zovi-n\n\na - ei ■ tOh] in\n\nan -Om\n\nfruits",

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

In the following section\n\nwe discuss the nature of the verbal reflexive in Mizo.\n\n7.2. Various Functions of the Verbal Reflexive\n\n✓ ■\n\n7.2.1. Self -benefactive (aatmanepada )\n\nThe aatmanepada self-benefactive marker in has the same form as- in ,the verbal reflexive in Mizo. When a third person pronoun occurs with the direct object it\n\n■ ^\nW*\n\n\frefers to somebody and not to Zova in sentence (15) . Hence, the occurrence of the self benefactive in is not permitted in such sentences. Notice that in sentence (14) in which there is no third person pronoun with the direct object self-benefactivein occurs. Fpr example:\n\n(14) (15)\n\nzova-0\n\nkut a - in\n\nsil\n\nZova ERG hands 3SG VR\n\nwash\n\n'Zova washed his(self's) hands.'\n\n*zova\ns.\nZova\n\na -kut a -in -sil his hand 3SG VR wash\n\n'Zova washed his hand.'\n\nWhen the self-benefactive occurs the ergative marker in in cannot occur with the subject (cf. sentences( 14)- (15) ). That is the self benefactive detransitivizes the verb just as a VR does. The absence of the ergative marker is indcated by 0 in (14). The presence of the self benefactive clearly indicates that the subject is the beneficiary of the action. Consider sentences (16) (17) and (18).\n\n(16) (17)\n\nzova-0 a - in- sil Zova ERG 3SG VR wash 'Zova is.washing himself.' zova-n a - sil Zova ERG 3SG wash\n\nx\n■\n\n\f(18)\n\n'Zova is washing (someone).' zova-0 a -in -bual zova ERG 3SG v r bath 'Zova is bathing.'\n\nNote that in (16) and (18), the VR occurs and Zova is the beneficiary of the action. Since the subject and the direct object are identical,there is no ergative marker with the subject. In (17), the beneficiary of the action is not identical to the subject, therefore, the ergative marker occurs.\nThe third person possessive pronoun may have the subject as its antecedent or may have arbitrary reference.Sentence (19) is illustrative:\n\n(19)",

As an Inchoative Marker\n\n\fThe verbal reflexive in also occurs as a DETRANSITIVIZER (INCHOATIVE) in Mizo. The following sentences are illustrative:\n\n(27) a.\n\nkor^khaar cu a -in\n\n- hQng\n\ndoor, FOC 3SG INCHOATIVE opened ,\n\n'The door opened.'\n\nb.\n\nlaali-n k.hprjkhaar a- hQng\n\nLali ERG door\n\n3SG open\n\n“Lali opened the door'.\n\n(28) a.\n\nkor^khaar door\n\na n -in i\n3SG INCHOATIVE\n\nkhar closed\n\n'The door closed’.\n\nb.\n\nlaala-n k^orikhaar a- khar\n\nK Laia ERG door\n\n3SG close\n\nvLala closed the door'. 7.2.3. The Occurrence of the Verbal Reflexive in the\n\nFormation of Certain Lexical Items\n\nThe verbal reflexive in occurs in the formation of\n.S'\nlexical item. For example , one of the days of the\nweek, namely, Saturday contains in.\n\nspecif!\n\nin - rin\n\n- ni\n\nVR prepare day\n\n'A day for preparing oneself'(for. the Sunday that will\n\n•follow)\n\nThe verbal reflexive in prefixed to verbs such as\n■:i >r.\n\n\fhria'know1 ,tl 'say, 1nei-'have1 imparts the interpretation of'bele.i.ve1 ,\n\nhria 'believe' fin-tl 'think',in-nei'marry', The occurrence of\n\nin with such verbs does not detransitivize the verb. Thus, the\n\nergative marker in occurs with the subject when such verbs\n\n-Occur.\n\nTo summarize, Mizo uses verbal and nominal devices in\n\nreflexive constructions; The presence of the\n\\.\nis optional whereas the presence of the\n\nnominal verbal\n\nreflexive reflexive\n\nis obligatory. The nominal reflexive is a reduplicated form and",

Their position is immediately following the adverbial particles (which can also mark aspect). Aspect markers relate an event to the time axis. They indicate if an event has happened yet, and if the event is completed or about to be completed. They also indicate how soon one can expect an event to take place and whether or not the event has been a long-awaited one. Several aspect markers have similar meanings with just shades of difference in their interpretation. Traditional grammarians have mistaken them for tense markers, even though their examples clearly show that Mizo does not mark tense (see Lorrain and Savidge (1898)). The following examples illustrate the versatility of aspect markers:\n\n(107) a. a\n\nkal.1 to?\n\n3NOM go PST/COMPL\n\n(S)he already left.\n\nb. a kal.1 taa3\n3NOM go at last (S)he has left at last.\n\nc. a kal.1 cia?

Because it is connected to a future event, it is often mistaken for a future tense marker. The examples below will demonstrate that it is different from the future tense marker for several reasons. For instance, it follows the negation\n\n\f132 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\nmarker whereas the future tense marker precedes it. The fact that they can both occur within the same phrase indicates that their functions are different\n\n(108) a. a\n\nkall ang2\n\n3NOM go MOD\n\n(S)he will go.\n\nb. a\n\nkall Jou ang2\n\n3NOM go NEG MOD\n\n(S)he will not go.\n\nc. a\n\nkall doonl Jou ang2\n\n3NOM go ASP NEG MOD\n\n(S)he will not be going.",

                "content": "The grammar ofsimple clauses in Mizo 133\nhave a wide variety of phonological shapes and generally also have a wide variety of tones; cf. plural affixes. I have further subdivided grammatical words into three categories: clitics, particles and words. Of these, only the last can constitute the major word classes while the others are modifiers of some sort. The distinction between clitics and particles is not very clear at this point. In general, clitics are obligatory whereas particles are not. Particles can also be distinguished by their phonological properties. For instance, particles and words have similar phonological shapes but particles usually do not undergo the SYLLABLE S1RENGTHENING RULE9 and are affected by intonation. Moreover, particles have very little lexical content but are highly functional.\nThe test to differentiate between clitics and affixes is even more difficult to conduct. Phonological rules are helpful in distinguishing between the two. For instance, clitics behave like independent words whereas affixes can change their phonological shape under certain conditions. A good example is the determiners where the tone of the ergative suffix combines with the tone of the determiner to form a different tone. Moreover, affixes are often one phonological unit: the demonstrative pronoun plural marker -ng, for instance.\n\n2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes. These are some of the more important ones:\n\n2.6.1.1 Gender suffix",

These are some of the more important ones:\n\n2.6.1.1 Gender suffix\n\nAll proper names must have a gender suffix (see also section 2.3.2.4). The female gender suffix -i 1 and the male gender suffix -a are dropped in the vocative case, if the name is longer than two syllables. The vocative case is indicated by a low tone on the final syllable. For female names, the low tone of the vocative combines with the high tone of the affix so that the tone becomes a falling tone. Thus we get TONE CONTOURINGlO as in the case of determiners followed by ergative markers. (Tone contouring does not apply to male names because they are low tone in citation form.) Consider the following examples:\n\n(110) a. Maaml-a b. Maaml-aa c. Maaml-il d. Maaml-ii3 e. Maaml-boi?-a\n-EMT-MSUF\nf. Maam 1-boi?-i1\n-EMT-FSUF\ng. Maaml-boi?\n\nMama (boy's nickname) Mama! (vocative) Marni (girl's nickname) Marni! (vocative) Mambawiha (usually firstbom son)\nMambawihi\nMambawih! (vocative)\n\n\f134 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\n2.6.1.2 Plural suffix\n\nPronouns are the only items marked for number. Each of the different types of pronouns have their own plural form. Thus, -nii3 is the plural marker for full pronouns, -n is the plural marker for subject pronoun clitics and -ng is the plural marker for the demonstrative pronouns. (See also section 2.3.1.1 and section 2.3.2.5.) For example:\n\n(111) a. kei2 ka :zaail lPRO lNOM sing I sing\n\nb. kei-nii3 ka-n\n\n:zaail\n\nlPRO-PL lNOM-PL sing\n\nwe sing\n\nc. ka zaail lNOM sing I sing\n\nd. ka-n\n\nzaai 1\n\nlNOM-PL sing\n\nwe sing\n\ne. hee noul hil DPRO cup DET this cup\n\nf. hee3-ng noul hiJ DPRO-PL cup DET these cups\n\nThe plural marker for the demonstrative pronoun is restricted to non-humans. Thus one cannot have:\n\n(112)\n\n*hee3-ng mii3 hil DPRO-PL cup DET these people\n\nInstead, the preferred form is:\n\n(113)\n\nhee mii3 tel hil DPRO person EX DET these people and such",

This ergative suffix is often obscured by the ergative case marker in because in non-emphatic contexts the two collapse and undergo predictable tone sandhi, for example:\n(16) //hil + an#in//4/hian3/\nIn emphatic contexts, however, this rule may be inhibited leaving both ergative suffix and ergative case marker intact, as in:\n(17) //hil + an#in//4 /lu\"an3 in/ The same is true for the oblique marker inl.\nPlurals, location markers, gender suffixes and norninalisers are separated from noun stems by formative boundaries whereas case markers are separated by internal word boundaries.\n\n\f102 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n2.3.2 Nouns Nouns occur in all syllable types and in all four tones.

                "content": "2.6.1 Affixes There are relatively few affixes. These are some of the more important ones:\n\n2.6.1.1 Gender suffix\n\nAll proper names must have a gender suffix (see also section 2.3.2.4). The female gender suffix -i 1 and the male gender suffix -a are dropped in the vocative case, if the name is longer than two syllables. The vocative case is indicated by a low tone on the final syllable. For female names, the low tone of the vocative combines with the high tone of the affix so that the tone becomes a falling tone. Thus we get TONE CONTOURINGlO as in the case of determiners followed by ergative markers. (Tone contouring does not apply to male names because they are low tone in citation form.) Consider the following examples:\n\n(110) a. Maaml-a b. Maaml-aa c. Maaml-il d. Maaml-ii3 e. Maaml-boi?-a\n-EMT-MSUF\nf. Maam 1-boi?-i1\n-EMT-FSUF\ng. Maaml-boi?\n\nMama (boy's nickname) Mama! (vocative) Marni (girl's nickname) Marni! (vocative) Mambawiha (usually firstbom son)\nMambawihi\nMambawih! (vocative)\n\n\f134 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\n2.6.1.2 Plural suffix\n\nPronouns are the only items marked for number. Each of the different types of pronouns have their own plural form. Thus, -nii3 is the plural marker for full pronouns, -n is the plural marker for subject pronoun clitics and -ng is the plural marker for the demonstrative pronouns. (See also section 2.3.1.1 and section 2.3.2.5.) For example:\n\n(111) a. kei2 ka :zaail lPRO lNOM sing I sing\n\nb. kei-nii3 ka-n\n\n:zaail\n\nlPRO-PL lNOM-PL sing\n\nwe sing\n\nc. ka zaail lNOM sing I sing\n\nd. ka-n\n\nzaai 1\n\nlNOM-PL sing\n\nwe sing\n\ne. hee noul hil DPRO cup DET this cup\n\nf. hee3-ng noul hiJ DPRO-PL cup DET these cups\n\nThe plural marker for the demonstrative pronoun is restricted to non-humans. Thus one cannot have:\n\n(112)\n\n*hee3-ng mii3 hil DPRO-PL cup DET these people\n\nInstead, the preferred form is:\n\n(113)\n\nhee mii3 tel hil DPRO person EX DET these people and such",

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

These are some of the more important ones:\n\n2.6.1.1 Gender suffix\n\nAll proper names must have a gender suffix (see also section 2.3.2.4). The female gender suffix -i 1 and the male gender suffix -a are dropped in the vocative case, if the name is longer than two syllables. The vocative case is indicated by a low tone on the final syllable. For female names, the low tone of the vocative combines with the high tone of the affix so that the tone becomes a falling tone. Thus we get TONE CONTOURINGlO as in the case of determiners followed by ergative markers. (Tone contouring does not apply to male names because they are low tone in citation form.)

This will be mainly in the area of defining word boundaries. For the moment, I have decided to mark only two grammatical boundaries: morpheme boundaries are indicated by - and word boundaries are marked with a space. My decisions are based on the guidelines given by Hyman (1978) and Zwicky (1985). These boundaries correspond to phonological boundaries as follows: the phonological word corresponds to the grammatical phrase; internal word boundaries in phonology correspond to grammatical word boundaries; morpheme boundaries are the same, though they are much more significant in the grammar than in the phonology. I have not marked the grammatical phrase boundary as it is marked morphologically by the final case markers.\nThe following sections are an attempt to bring together the works mentioned above, using more recent linguistic tools. I have used terms, such as N', in the manner of Radford (1981) and the categorisations are based roughly on Giv6n's (1984) typological approach to syntax. Even though this paper will not get into the theoretical details, I will make theoretical assumptions based on current linguistic theories. In particular, the notion of ergativity will be a major consideration of the following sections. In this area I am indebted to Lehman's (1985) and DeLancey's (1981a) discussions of ergativity in TB languages.\n2.2 Noun phrase structure\nThe noun phrase structure of Mizo is fairly complex. The most characteristic feature of the NPs is that they can be demarcated on the left by a demonstrative pronoun and on the right by a case marker (CM). The obligatory case markers for the NP are preceded by the determiner: plurality markers and locational markers are suffixed on the demonstrative pronoun.",

They form one phonological word where the second morpheme is some sort of modifier of the first morpheme. In a few cases, the meaning of the individual morphemes is opaque. The following words illustrate a number of these combinations:\n\n(19) a. saa3\nanimal\n\n+ mak strange\n\n= sa-mak\nrhinocerous\n\nb. faa3\n\n+ paa\n\noffspring\n\nmale\n\n= fd-paa = son\n\nc. mii3 person\n\n+ paa male\n\n= mi-paa = man/boy\n\nd. seer citrus\n\n+ thuur2 sour\n\n= seer-thuur2\nlemon\n\ne. bee3 beans\n\n+ tee2 small\n\n= be-tee2\ntype of bean\n\nNames of birds and animals are usually prefixed by vaa3 'bird' and saa3 'animal' respectively. However, in most cases the second morpheme is not a free form. For instance:\n\n\fThe grammar of simple clauses in Mizo 103\n\n(20) a. saa3 b. vaa3\n\n+ voml + rak\n\n= sa-voml = va-rak\n\nbear duck\n\nThus, the word is 'non-Fregean', that is, it cannot be divided into meaningful parts.\n\n(21) a. cingJ-nhia2 b. cai-ciiml c. fang3-mhiir d. be-raam\n\nwolf mouse ant sheep\n\n2.3.2.3 Nominalised nouns\n\nAbstract nouns are derived by nominalising adjectives or verbs (see also section 2.6.1.5).

It goes without saying that, for this particular aspect of phonological theory, I have been greatly influenced by concepts like the core:periphery distinction of the Prague School and the Prosodic Approach of the Firthian School.\nAd (4) :\nThe concept of rules holding a key position in generative theory must be subject to criticism as long as no further criteria are imposed re­ garding uncontrolled and unwarranted applications. Instead of applying criteria such as 'naturalness conditions' in phonology which, in its most ridiculous attempt, has amounted to counting symbols as sole indi­ cators of different degrees of complexity, I have developed a criterion which is based on plausibility considerations. The ’cost' with which the explanation by a rule is imputed, is, in my theoretical framework, immediately calculable by measuring the degree of plausibility with re­ ference to the explanatory value that is attached to every component of the morphophonological level. In this context, the reader may be re­ minded of the three kinds of possible concepts of measurement, viz., classificatory concepts (e.g., terms like warm, hot, cortd in measuring temperature), coi^ara^ve (or topological) concepts (e.g., terms like warmer than, as warm at , etc.), and metr^a1, that is, purety quantitarive, concepts ^.g. 20 degaees cent^rade} . The ^onoh^ca1 compo­ nents as introduced in this essay have been conceived as comparative terms.\nThroughout the book, phonetic forms have been put between square brackets in accordance with the conventions established by the Interna­ tional Phonetic Association (revised Inbernationot Phanetze Alphabet of 1951).\nThe translation of Lushai words has been taken over literally from\nIx",

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Jre naaul le? soo naaul soo3-n in mil veel\nthis child and that child DET-ERG ERG IACC hit This child and that child hit me.\n\n2.6.2.3 Oblique marker\nThe oblique marker also marks instruments. Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

There are several variations of whquestions. The basic form consists of the wh word followed by the question word. Of these, eng can be modified for questions involving time, reason or purpose, see 45c, d. The deictic wh word khoi3 can also be used for questions involving spatial location and spatial direction.\nWh-questions are further classified according to whether or not the subject is known. If the subject is unknown but the object is known, then the question takes the regular class of verbs. Moreover, nominative markers are absent in this type of wh-question. Therefore, questioned subject and object will be differentiated not only in the NPs but also in the choice of verb stem. Wh-questions with Stem I verbs are shown in the next three examples. All wh-questions have the same construction, the only difference being in the choice of the wh word.

This type of question requires only one question marker em2 at the end of the sentence, with the verb taking the stem appropriate for its clause type. Thus, for example:\n\n(47) a. i\n\ndaml em2\n\n2NOM well Q\n\nAre you well? (traditional greeting)\n\nb. i2-n\n\nlou-kall doonl em2\n\n2NOM-PL come ASP Q\n\nAre you planning to come?\n\nc. mk i2-n vul? doonl em2 pig 2NOM-PL raise ASP Q Are you going to raise pigs?\n\nd. coo3 i-n eil angl em2 food 2NOM-PL eat MOD Q Will you be eating?\n\n3.4.3 Alternative questions\n\nWh-questions take the prefix al-when the question is about one particular item out of a larger set, cf. example 118 in section 2.6.1.3.\n\n(48) a. al-tuu tel ngee3 lou-kall of-WH EX Q come Who all came (out of those we invited)?\n\nb. al-eng tel ngee3 iJ lei of-WH EX Q 2NOM buyrr Which ones/what all did you buy?\n\nc. al-eng khul ngee3 ka-n peek3 ang2\n\nof-WH DET Q INOM-PL\n\ngiven\n\nWhich of the things down there should we give?\n\nMOD\n\nThe above types can sometimes be ambiguous. For instance, example 48b can also mean 'Which of these did you buy for him/her?'.\n\n3.4.4 Echo questions\nThe simplest form of echo question is an unmodified wh-question, following a statement. The question 'who?' or 'what?' is inserted mainly for the speaker's benefit. This type of question uses moo2 instead of ngee3.\n\n\fThe grammar ofsimple clauses in Mizo 163",

It is usually not necessary to have quantifying particles in both noun phrase and verb phrase.\n\nThe examples below will show the difference between the two types.\n\n(141) a. .ka aarl zong zong3 mil lei. sak.\n\nIP hen\n\nall\n\nIACC buyII BEN\n\n(S)he bought all my hens for/from me.\n\nb. .ka aarl min2 lei sak. vek1 IP hen IACC buyII BEN all (S)he bought all my hens for/from me.\n\n\f144 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\nc. aarl tam2 tak .a lei2 hen many INT 3NOM bought (S)he bought several hens.\n\nd. aarl a lei treu'l 1 hen 3NOM buy many (S)he bought several hens.\n\ne. a2-n\n\nvaai2 inl\n\na-n\n\nchuak3\n\n3PRO-PL all OBLQ 3NOM-PL exit\n\nThey all left.\n\nf. a-n\n\nchuak3 vek 1\n\n3NOM-PL exit all\n\nThey all left.\n\nThus, from the above it appears as though the quantifiers in both the noun phrase and the verb phrase have similar meanings. However, there are fewer types of quantifiers in the verb phrase. The postverbal quantifiers also seem to express degree, besides quantity. They are used mostly for uncountable items whereas the quantifiers in the noun phrase are usually countable.\n\nCompare the following examples:\n\n(142) a. voi3 tam2 tak mil vuaa times many INT lACC beat (S)he beat me several times.\n\nb. mil m rhep 1 lACC beat severely (S)he gave me a severe beating.\n\n2.6.3.4 Intensifiers\n\nIntensifiers generally follow a general quantifier or an adjective, as in:\n\n(143) a. pang-paarl t.am2 tak ka lei2\n\nflower\n\nmany INT lNOM buy\n\nI bought many flowers.\n\nb. pang-paarl mooil tak kE.1 mhuu\n\nflower\n\npretty INT lNOM see\n\nI saw a very beautiful flower.\n\nc. pang-paarl mooil em3 em3 kE.1 mhuu\n\nflower\n\npretty INT INOM see\n\nI saw a very, very beautiful flower.\n\n\fThe grammar of simple clauses in Miw 145\n\nd. pang-paarl maoil luJ-tuk kal mhuu\n\nflower\n\npretty INT lNOM see",

Of these, eng can be modified for questions involving time, reason or purpose, see 45c, d.

The more common NP quantifiers are: zong zong3 'each and every', trhen 1 khat 'some (of the whole)', vaai2 'all/everything', zaa 'all/every', tam2 tak 'several, many', deem2 tee2 'very few' and tin3 'each' (refer to section 2.6.3.3 for VP quantifiers). See also section 2.6.1.2 for plural markers.\nThese are examples of NP quantifiers:\n\n(47) a. aarl zong zong3 hen all all the hens\n\nb. aarl tam2 tak hen many INT many hens\n\nc. aarl deem 1 te2 hen few little few hens\n\nd. aarl hou3 hen group group of hens\n\ne. a2-n vaai2 inl a-n kall 3P-PL all OBLQ 3NOM-PL went they all went\n\nf. mii3 zong zong3 a-n kall\n\npeople all\n\n3NOM-PL went\n\nall the people went\n\ng. mi tin3 a-n kal 1 person each 3NOM-PL go each person went\n\nh. an-nii3 hou3 a-n kal 1 3PRO-PL group 3NOM-PL go they went (together)\n\ni. an hou3 te 1 a-n kal 1\n3P PL group EX 3NOM-PL go their party went\n\n\f112 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\n2.3.5.3 Plurality\nNumber is indicated either by morphology or by cardinal numbers. There is another optional plural particle, tel. When it occurs without the other number markers, tel has a slightly different meaning. In this instance, tel does not signify 'several of the specified item' but rather, 'the specified item plus others associated with it'. Compare the following examples:\n\n(48) a. kal nuu3 tel kal paa3 tel IP mother EX IP father EX my mother, father, etc.\n\nb. ka Juul tel kal cal\n\ntel\n\nIP head EX IP forehead EX\n\nmy head, forehead, etc.\n\nThe above examples clearly show that the particle te 1 does not indicate plurality even though it indicates a collection of subjects. Its true contribution, however, more resembles English etc. which indicates that the overt forms are merely examples of a longer list. Therefore, it is understandable that te 1 occurs in plural NPs, as the listed forms may only be indicative of a larger set, e.g.",

For instance, example 48b can also mean 'Which of these did you buy for him/her?'.\n\n3.4.4 Echo questions\nThe simplest form of echo question is an unmodified wh-question, following a statement.

Introduction In this chapter, we will discuss the formation of relative\nclauses, the types of relative clauses, the various positions in which the relative clause can occur, the constituents that can be deleted either in the relative clause or in the matrix clause and the position of the determiner in a relative clause in Mizo. We will show how the modification of oblique objects differs from the modification of nonoblique objects, namely, subject, object and indirect object. We will discuss the differences in the position of occurrence of relative clauses vis a vis adjectives. We will focus our attention on the syntactic change in progress in Mizo with regard to the position of occurrence of the relative clause. We will attempt to provide an explanation as to why such change is taking place. We will discuss the morphophonemic changes that take place in the constituents of- the relative clause. We will argue that the relative clause in Mizo is neither a full-fledged relative clause nor a full-fledged participial clause. We;;will, show that the relative clause can modify all the noun phrase positions of the accessibility hierarchy proposed in Keenan and Comrie (1977).\n11.1.

Introduction In this chapter, we will discuss the formation of relative\nclauses, the types of relative clauses, the various positions in which the relative clause can occur, the constituents that can be deleted either in the relative clause or in the matrix clause and the position of the determiner in a relative clause in Mizo. We will show how the modification of oblique objects differs from the modification of nonoblique objects, namely, subject, object and indirect object. We will discuss the differences in the position of occurrence of relative clauses vis a vis adjectives. We will focus our attention on the syntactic change in progress in Mizo with regard to the position of occurrence of the relative clause. We will attempt to provide an explanation as to why such change is taking place. We will discuss the morphophonemic changes that take place in the constituents of- the relative clause. We will argue that the relative clause in Mizo is neither a full-fledged relative clause nor a full-fledged participial clause. We;;will, show that the relative clause can modify all the noun phrase positions of the accessibility hierarchy proposed in Keenan and Comrie (1977).\n11.1.

There is a small number of loanwords of\n\nIndic and Burmese origin depicting structural patterns suited for an in­\n\nterpretation in terms of £-rules. Let us choose, for instance, a disyl­\n\nlabic morpheme like / pu _ru:n/ \"onion\", which could be rendered morpho-\n\nphonologi cally asv\n\ni;i_pru:ni !;\n\nor a trisyllabic morpheme like /_teo ^te _re/ \"tamarind11 with possible\n\nderivation from\n\ni l.tetj _re | r j = ;, I .ten _re| |.\n\nThe questions arising in this context are twofold: (1) Up to what structural level can ^-processes be allowed to oper­ ate? (2) Which structural level is suited best for the representation of loanwords?\nGiven the analogy of p-rules which became invalid on the level of PEp a point can be made to restrict the application of r-rules in the same way, i.e., let it apply only to PE^/PE2 structures. If these loanwords are interpreted as constitutive elements of PEi structures, the application of r becomes obligatory. If they are adjusted to PE^, there is no ac­ counting for the fact that they appear to be better adapted to original Lushai sound structure than English loanwords. Eventually, this could lead to the establishment of a core : periphery distinction within PEe; in such a system, priority would be given to Indic loanwords by placing\n\n\fEXTENSION\n\n85",

When it does occur, quantification is preceded by all the other constituents within the NP, except for the determiner and the case marker. Unlike qualifiers, quantifiers show a much more rigid word order:\n\n(38)\n\nQnP\n\nQ~EX\n\n~I\n\nNum'\n\nQn\n\ntel\n\n~\n\nek.\n\nCLF Num\n\nI\n\npa\n\nkua 2\n\nI .I\nunit mne\n\nhou3\nI\ngroup\n\n'group of nine and such'\n\nThe quantifiers in the NP agree in number with the subject pronoun clitics in the VP. The logic of quantification in Mizo is more involved and it will be discussed separately in section 3.1.2. See also Lehman (1979b).\n\n2.3.5.1 Numeral quantifiers\nUnlike most other south-east Asian languages, Mizo does not have a semantically based system of noun classifiers, cf. Lehman (1979a). The numbering system, however, does display a · system of classifiers where the unit classifier is pa-, (as suggested by Lehman in personal communications). The classifiers for tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. are soom, zaa, saang2, respectively. The numbering system is decimal, as shown below:\n\n(39) a. pa-khat\n\none\n\nb. pa-nhi?\n\ntwo\n\nc. pa-thuml three\n\nd. pa-1iil\n\nfour\n\ne. pa-ngaa 1 five\n\nf. pa-ruk g. pa-sa-ri? h. pa-riat3 1. pa-kua2 J. soom\n\nsix seven eight nine ten\n\n\fThe grammar ofsimple clauses in Mizo 109",

In this analysis, a point is made to grant a single phonological extension system as much a priori independence as possible from its neighbouring extension systems.

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Jre naaul le? soo naaul soo3-n in mil veel\nthis child and that child DET-ERG ERG IACC hit This child and that child hit me.\n\n2.6.2.3 Oblique marker\nThe oblique marker also marks instruments. Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.",

Introduction\nIn this chapter we will study the characteristics of the ergative construction in Mizo. We shall show that Mizo exhibits split ergativity. We will discuss the inherent relationship between the ergative case marking and agreement on the verb. We will also focus our attention on relative clauses, passives and clefts in Mizo where the ergative and the agreement markers are either present or absent in these constructions as two possible alternative constructions. We shall show -that Mizo is in a transitional stage with regard to ergativity as some syntactic features of a pure ergative constructions have been lost.\n\n5.1. Types of Languages -Case Marking and Verb Agreement ' iI\nWith rergard to nominal case marking and verb agreement, there are two types of languages: nominative-accusative type,and ergative-absolutive type.12 In the.nominative -accusative type, the verb typically agrees with the subject noun phrase in the sentence. For example, in English,in the sentences\n\n(1)\n\nJohn loves Mary\n\n(2)\n\nThe show pleased everybody.\n\nThe verbs loves and show in (1) and (2) respectively agree with the noun phrase which is in the subject position.\nIn the ergative-absolutive system, the agent ( subject) of an intransitive sentence and the patient of a transitive sentence\n\n\fo / n w>\nO ' n , D o ’ ;O / o\nO (~y\nO D : o , o o c\nO\no O ' o o \" >,) ■:\nl.) ;\n,o ’o ' O r D ,, o\np C: :D (^\nr'\\\nQ l .o V-\n;o;\nB o-\no o\no\no u / \\ i. J\nu\nu t> o\n\n■,have the SAME case marking which is generally referred to as the\n\nabsolutive case marking. The agent in such sentences carries a different case marker, termed as the ergative case marker. The\n\nverb in such cases\n\nmay\n\nexhibit agreement with the\n\npatient,/theme (for a detailed discussion, see Comrie, 1978) or .\n\nin some languages it may exhibit agreement with the agent itself.",

Such a linking strategy makes the original sentence a\n\nembedded clause in cleft sentences.\n\nLet us now see what happens to the subject of a cleft\n\nsentence when the subject is questioned.

Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1).

Their position is immediately following the adverbial particles (which can also mark aspect). Aspect markers relate an event to the time axis. They indicate if an event has happened yet, and if the event is completed or about to be completed. They also indicate how soon one can expect an event to take place and whether or not the event has been a long-awaited one. Several aspect markers have similar meanings with just shades of difference in their interpretation. Traditional grammarians have mistaken them for tense markers, even though their examples clearly show that Mizo does not mark tense (see Lorrain and Savidge (1898)). The following examples illustrate the versatility of aspect markers:\n\n(107) a. a\n\nkal.1 to?\n\n3NOM go PST/COMPL\n\n(S)he already left.\n\nb. a kal.1 taa3\n3NOM go at last (S)he has left at last.\n\nc. a kal.1 cia?

Because it is connected to a future event, it is often mistaken for a future tense marker. The examples below will demonstrate that it is different from the future tense marker for several reasons. For instance, it follows the negation\n\n\f132 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\nmarker whereas the future tense marker precedes it. The fact that they can both occur within the same phrase indicates that their functions are different\n\n(108) a. a\n\nkall ang2\n\n3NOM go MOD\n\n(S)he will go.\n\nb. a\n\nkall Jou ang2\n\n3NOM go NEG MOD\n\n(S)he will not go.\n\nc. a\n\nkall doonl Jou ang2\n\n3NOM go ASP NEG MOD\n\n(S)he will not be going.",

These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses.

These particles immediately follow adverbial particles and are used to indicate various aspects of an event, such as whether it has happened yet, is completed, or is about to happen. Examples include particles like 'taa3', 'cia?', 'meekl', 'treep3', and 'daon1', which are used to mark different aspects of the verb. Thus, the language is coded as 1 for having non-inflecting phonologically free aspect markers.",

                "content": "The grammar of simple cmuses in Mizo 131\n\n2.5.5 Aspect markers\n\nAspect markers are particles and not lexical words. Their position is immediately following the adverbial particles (which can also mark aspect). Aspect markers relate an event to the time axis. They indicate if an event has happened yet, and if the event is completed or about to be completed. They also indicate how soon one can expect an event to take place and whether or not the event has been a long-awaited one. Several aspect markers have similar meanings with just shades of difference in their interpretation. Traditional grammarians have mistaken them for tense markers, even though their examples clearly show that Mizo does not mark tense (see Lorrain and Savidge (1898)). The following examples illustrate the versatility of aspect markers:\n\n(107) a. a\n\nkal.1 to?\n\n3NOM go PST/COMPL\n\n(S)he already left.\n\nb. a kal.1 taa3\n3NOM go at last (S)he has left at last.\n\nc. a kal.1 cia? I 3NOM go just now (S)he just left.\n\nd. a kal.1 meekl\n3NOM go PROG (S)he is going.\n\ne. a\n\nkal.1 treep3\n\n3NOM go IMM FUT\n\n(S)he is just about to leave.\n\nf. a kal.1 daonl 3NOM go ASP (S)he is going to leave/go.\n\ng. a\n\nkal.1 daonl to?\n\n3NOM go ASP PST/COMPL\n\n(S)he is going to leave/go shortly.\n\nh. a\n\nkal.1 daon I treep3\n\n3NOM go ASP IMM FUT\n\n(S)he is almost leaving.\n\n2.5.6 Mode marker\nThe mode marker ang2 marks a probable event or state. Because it is connected to a future event, it is often mistaken for a future tense marker. The examples below will demonstrate that it is different from the future tense marker for several reasons. For instance, it follows the negation\n\n\f132 Lalnunthangi Chhangte\n\nmarker whereas the future tense marker precedes it. The fact that they can both occur within the same phrase indicates that their functions are different\n\n(108) a. a\n\nkall ang2\n\n3NOM go MOD\n\n(S)he will go.\n\nb. a\n\nkall Jou ang2\n\n3NOM go NEG MOD\n\n(S)he will not go.\n\nc. a\n\nkall doonl Jou ang2\n\n3NOM go ASP NEG MOD\n\n(S)he will not be going.",

Adverbs and direct object NPs are optional constituents of the VP just as in many other languages. The clitic pronoun, however, is required in every sentence (except for relative clauses, imperatives and subjectless wh-questions, cf. 3.4.1). Therefore, I assign it to a special level of the VP called V\". The remaining particles for mode, negation, aspect, etc. are optional again. So these can be dominated by a recursive V' constituent. A second and very persuasive argument that the pronoun clitics require their own V-bar constituent (here V\") is seen in the behaviour of the second person accusative pronoun clitic eel 'you', eel ul 'you (pl)', cf. example 51 below.\n(51) a. mi-sual2 in a manl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch 2ACC A criminal has caught you.\nb. mi-sual2 in a manl doonl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch ASP 2ACC A criminal is going to catch you.\nAt present I know of no tests to decide which of the two clitics is higher in the structure.

The adverbs are manner adverbs, adverbs of time and adverbs of place. The last two adverbs are very similar. Adverbs that precede the verb require some sort of modifier, such as the oblique marker or the locative marker. There is no such restriction on postverbal adverbs.\n\n2.5.1.1 Manner adverbs",

The (a) sentences below illustrate the instances where the subject contains both the conjuncts and the (b) sentences below illustrate the corresponding sentences in which one of the pronominal conjuncts is deleted.\n\n(40a) (40b) (41a) (41b)\n\nzova- 0\n\nkei maah neen kan- in -ang\n\nZova ERG I EMPH and IPL REC resemble\n\n'Zova and I resemble each other'.\n\nzova- 0 neen kan-in -ang\n\nZova ERG and 1 PL REC resemble\n\n'Zova and I/we resemble each other.'\n\nzova- 0\n\nnang maah neen in- in- ang\n\nZova ERG You EMPH and 2PL REC resemble\n\n'Zova and you resemble each other'.\n\nzova- 0 Zova ERG\n\nneen in -in -ang ; r\nand ‘i! 2PL REC resemble\n\nyvA.\n\n\f(42a) (42b)\n\n'Zova and you (SG)/you(PL) resettible each other.' nang maah kei maah neen kan- in - ang You EMPH I EMPH and 1PL REC resemble 'You and I resemble each other'. nang maah neen kan-in -ang you EMPH and 1PL REC resemble 'You and I/we resemble each other.'",

In the previous section we have seen the internal structure of the phrases: attributes follow the head noun (see section 2.3.4 and 2.3.5); case markers follow the head noun (see sections 2.6.2.2 and 2.6.2.3): genitival-of constructions precede the head noun (sections 2.3.3 and 2.6.1.3). Moreover, as we will see in section 4, relative clauses precede the main clause.\n\nAt the sentence level, the normal order is SOV.\n\n(13) naul-pangl in sa-zuu3 ~ a manl\n\nchild\n\nERG rat ABS 3NOM catch\n\nThe child caught a rat.\n\nPermutation is allowed when there is a change in focus.
