Three or more examples of indefinite/non-specific nominals occurring with an indefinite/non-specific article is sufficient to code 1. \n\nAn indefinite article is a marker that accompanies the indefinite noun and expresses notions such as non-specificity and indefiniteness. Sometimes these notions of non-specificity and indefiniteness are summed up in the term ‘identifiability’. A language does not necessarily have both a non-specific/indefinite and a specific/definite marker. These markers often stem from very different sources (numerals and demonstratives) and need not be similar in formal expression or position. \n\nThe formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone. Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm of markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum, making it hard to define discrete categories. Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning ‘a certain’. As articles necessarily accompany nouns, it is in these cases that it is necessary to investigate whether the marker can occur independently or not; if it can it is most likely a pronoun and not an article. Articles can be homophonous with pronouns and demonstratives, and also with classifiers.\n\n",

This feature has also been split into two binary features, \"GB024a Is the order of the numeral and noun Num-N?\" and \"GB024b Is the order of the numeral and noun N-Num?\". It is possible to answer 1 or 0 for one of the binarised features, and \"?\" for the other.\n\nIn some languages only one order (Numeral-Noun or Noun-Numeral) is possible. In other languages, both orders may be possible. This can take the form of free variation (where Numeral-Noun and Noun-Numeral order can occur interchangeably). The order may also depend on some other grammatical category which is neutral with respect to pragmaticality (e.g. definiteness). If the order depends on the noun, consider only the orders that apply to an open class of nouns and disregard orders that are restricted to a specific closed class of nouns.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Consider only phrases with the meaning 'X (numeral) units of Y (noun)' in their pragmatically neutral form. It does not matter what kind of construction is required (e.g. attributive *two books* or relative *books that are two*) or what word class the root or modifying form of the cardinal numerals belongs to, e.g. *two-ing books* (verb) or *two-some books* (noun) apply to this question.\n2. If the numeral always precedes the noun, code 1 for GB024 or 1 for GB024a. \n3. If the numeral always follows the noun, code 2 for GB024 or 1 for GB024b\n4. If a closed class of nouns requires a different order than an open class, disregard the closed class and code the order that applies to the open class.\n5. If both orders occur for an open class of nouns, that is if some numerals precede and some follow, or there is a free choice or there is a choice depending on some other factor (e.g. definiteness), code 3 for GB024 or 1 for GB024a and GB024b.\n\n",

For example, can you say ***the man** is running **big*** to mean ‘**the big man** is running’? \n\nTypically a language which allows this has extensive [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) systems so that you can still work out what modifies what in the NP without them being adjacent (e.g. the ‘Australian type’). NPs that are made up of several coordinated NPs that can be interpreted by the verb or other elements are not relevant here. This features aims specifically to capture the phenomenon of a single NP whose property words can occur outside of and not immediately adjacent to the portion of the NP that contains the head. Examples of the type *I painted the house red* or *I saw the boy big* are not necessarily discontinuous, but most likely resultative or contrastive (*I saw the boy big* [as opposed to before when he was small]). These should be disregarded for the purposes of this feature.\n\nNote that for the purposes of this feature only property words (e.g. *tall*, *red*, *friendly*) should be considered. Any other elements described as 'adjectives' or 'adjectival' in the grammatical description (e.g. quantifiers, demonstratives) should be disregarded in coding this feature.\n\n",

In some languages the only way to coordinate noun phrases is with a comitative phrase, i.e. the only way to say ‘X **and** Y’ is ‘X **with** Y’. To see whether an element is comitative or coordinating you can check case marking and agreement. For example, if X is the element in question and in the dative you get ‘John-DAT X Mary-DAT’, then X is likely coordinating. If you get ‘John-DAT X Mary’, X is likely comitative. If there is agreement, if you get ‘John X Mary verb-PL’ rather than 'John X Mary verb-SG' (just like ‘John X suitcase verb-SG’), this suggests that X is coordinating.\n\n",

Nouns are inflected for case and pronouns for number. Other important morphological categories include demonstrative pronouns, emphatic particles and numerical expressions. These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses. This chapter will discuss the morphological categories pertaining to noun phrases.\nCase marking will be dealt w ith first, followed by a discussion o f pronominal paradigms. Noun modifiers and quantifiers follow n ex t The last section illustrates lexical nominalization.\n\nCase Marking\n\nIn a simple declarative clause the case markers are: -in ergative, -m instrumental/adverbial and -a? locative. Absolutives are unmarked. Genitives are marked\n\nby high tone and vocative by a low tone. The following examples are illustrative.\n\n( l) a . keel-in nhim a-pet goat-ERG grass 3s-graze 'A/the goat is eating/grazing grass.'\n\nb. khool-m-\n\npuin ka-thfly\n\nmachine-INSTR cloth ls-sew\n\n'I am sewing with a machine.'\n\nc. kdn-huan-a?\n\nkeel a-lhht\n\nls.pl-garden-LOC goat 3s-enter\n\n'A/the goat entered our garden.'\n\n\fErgative\n\nLike many languages of this area, Mizo is an ergative language. The ergative\n\nsuffix -in marks all transitive subjects, regardless of their semantic role.\n\n(2) a. ka-nbu-m\n\nmin-vua\n\nlPoss-mother-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My mother beat me.'\n\nb. ka-nhit\n\nle? ka-p^a-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nlPoss-m otherand lPoss-father-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My m other and my father beat me.'\n\nc. ka-p&a-in\n\nloom=man a-doq\n\nlPoss-father-ERG prize\n\n3s-receive\n\n'My father received a prize.'\n\nInstrumental/Adverbial\n\nThe instrumental case marker is -in. It also functions as an adverbializer.\n\n(3) a. Kim-&n\n\ntiaq-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nKim-MASC.ERG stick-INSTR lo-beat\n\nTGma hit me with a stick.'\n\nb.

Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the categories _masculine_ and _feminine_ are relevant for noun class/gender assignment in a given language. A contrast between these categories in a noun class/gender system serves as a minimal criterion for this feature to be coded 1. Languages that overtly mark only one of these categories (e.g. feminine, with an unmarked class interpreted as non-feminine) do encode the relevant distinction and should be coded 1. A language may encode other socially or culturally relevant gender distinctions, and there may be cross-linguistic and cross-cultural differences in the semantics and membership of masculine and feminine categories. A language may also categorize nouns based on other factors entirely (e.g. shape, animacy, phonological properties). For the purposes of this feature, grammatical categories other than masculine and feminine should be disregarded. \n\nThe use of these two specific categories in the definition of this feature is meant to enable consistent coding and interpretation of data for a narrowly-defined, cross-linguistically common distinction.

See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether one of these factors distinguishes plants from other concepts. For this feature to be coded 1, there must be a clear pattern in which nouns that refer to plants or some subset of plant referents are assigned to one or more specific noun classes. \n\nAlthough the semantic factors in noun class/gender assignment are not always perfectly clear-cut, this feature targets those systems in which certain nouns are assigned to a particular class *because* their referents are plants. Systems in which several nominals with plant referents are assigned to a particular class because of their phonology or due to some more or less arbitrary assignment are not the target of this feature. That is, plant status must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender. However, it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment for a particular category.\n\n",

            "summary": "Is there a morpho-syntactic difference in attributive possession that can be ascribed to alienability? \n\nThis feature applies to constructions with both pronominal and nominal possessors. \n\nTypically, inalienable possession applies to the semantic domains of body parts and kinship, but it is sometimes found in other categories that do not align perfectly with the canonical notion of 'alienability', such as part-whole relationships other than body parts, social relationships other than kinship, or things inherently linked to a person (e.g. a person's voice, mental states, or other attributes).\n\nThis feature targets splits in possessive marking where different classes of possessum are associated with different constructions, and where one of those possessum classes includes body parts and/or kinship terms, and possibly other categories that have strong semantic associations with their owners, social relationships, or part-whole relationships.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. If there are two or more possessive constructions which vary according to the semantic class of the noun being possessed or the nature of the relationship between possessor and possessed,\n2. And the difference in the construction does not consist solely of a difference in noun class/gender markers, or other classifier systems such as numeral classifiers that also apply to these categories of nouns in the same way in non-possessive constructions,\n3. And the 'inalienable' semantic class associated with one of these strategies contains at least body part terms or at least kinship terms, then code 1.\n4. If there are not multiple possessive constructions, or if there are multiple possessive constructions that do not vary based on semantic class of the possessum, code 0.\n5.

Other important morphological categories include demonstrative pronouns, emphatic particles and numerical expressions. These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses. This chapter will discuss the morphological categories pertaining to noun phrases.\nCase marking will be dealt w ith first, followed by a discussion o f pronominal paradigms. Noun modifiers and quantifiers follow n ex t The last section illustrates lexical nominalization.\n\nCase Marking\n\nIn a simple declarative clause the case markers are: -in ergative, -m instrumental/adverbial and -a? locative. Absolutives are unmarked. Genitives are marked\n\nby high tone and vocative by a low tone. The following examples are illustrative.\n\n( l) a . keel-in nhim a-pet goat-ERG grass 3s-graze 'A/the goat is eating/grazing grass.'\n\nb. khool-m-\n\npuin ka-thfly\n\nmachine-INSTR cloth ls-sew\n\n'I am sewing with a machine.'\n\nc. kdn-huan-a?\n\nkeel a-lhht\n\nls.pl-garden-LOC goat 3s-enter\n\n'A/the goat entered our garden.'\n\n\fErgative\n\nLike many languages of this area, Mizo is an ergative language. The ergative\n\nsuffix -in marks all transitive subjects, regardless of their semantic role.\n\n(2) a. ka-nbu-m\n\nmin-vua\n\nlPoss-mother-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My mother beat me.'\n\nb. ka-nhit\n\nle? ka-p^a-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nlPoss-m otherand lPoss-father-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My m other and my father beat me.'\n\nc. ka-p&a-in\n\nloom=man a-doq\n\nlPoss-father-ERG prize\n\n3s-receive\n\n'My father received a prize.'\n\nInstrumental/Adverbial\n\nThe instrumental case marker is -in.

Nouns are inflected for case and pronouns for number. Other important morphological categories include demonstrative pronouns, emphatic particles and numerical expressions. These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses. This chapter will discuss the morphological categories pertaining to noun phrases.\nCase marking will be dealt w ith first, followed by a discussion o f pronominal paradigms. Noun modifiers and quantifiers follow n ex t The last section illustrates lexical nominalization.\n\nCase Marking\n\nIn a simple declarative clause the case markers are: -in ergative, -m instrumental/adverbial and -a? locative. Absolutives are unmarked. Genitives are marked\n\nby high tone and vocative by a low tone. The following examples are illustrative.\n\n( l) a . keel-in nhim a-pet goat-ERG grass 3s-graze 'A/the goat is eating/grazing grass.'\n\nb. khool-m-\n\npuin ka-thfly\n\nmachine-INSTR cloth ls-sew\n\n'I am sewing with a machine.'\n\nc. kdn-huan-a?\n\nkeel a-lhht\n\nls.pl-garden-LOC goat 3s-enter\n\n'A/the goat entered our garden.'\n\n\fErgative\n\nLike many languages of this area, Mizo is an ergative language. The ergative\n\nsuffix -in marks all transitive subjects, regardless of their semantic role.\n\n(2) a. ka-nbu-m\n\nmin-vua\n\nlPoss-mother-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My mother beat me.'\n\nb. ka-nhit\n\nle? ka-p^a-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nlPoss-m otherand lPoss-father-ERG lo-beat\n\n'My m other and my father beat me.'\n\nc. ka-p&a-in\n\nloom=man a-doq\n\nlPoss-father-ERG prize\n\n3s-receive\n\n'My father received a prize.'\n\nInstrumental/Adverbial\n\nThe instrumental case marker is -in. It also functions as an adverbializer.\n\n(3) a. Kim-&n\n\ntiaq-in\n\nmfn-vua\n\nKim-MASC.ERG stick-INSTR lo-beat\n\nTGma hit me with a stick.'\n\nb.

Nouns that express the function of an adposition in a possessive construction (e.g. ***inside** of the car* to mean 'in the car') only count if they are visibly grammaticalized and no longer fully behave like nouns.

Here we are interested in infixes that occur internal to the base form of a verb that is held in common across inflected forms (called the 'stem' here), rather than affixes that occur between a verb's root or stem and some inflectional affix(es) or clitic(s).\n\n\n",

Such infixes may be used for derivational meanings as well as aspectual or voice-changing functions, so grammar sections that describe these functions should be examined for evidence of infixation.\n2. Code 0 if infixing reduplication is described in verbs but no non-reduplicative infixes are mentioned. If you find evidence of infixing reduplication in verbs please leave a comment to note the presence of this reduplication pattern.\n3.

The morphological marking of these arguments (e.g. accusative case, dative case vs. adposition marking) is irrelevant for counting a construction as ditransitive.\n\n‘Marking’ for the purposes of this feature includes both flagging (i.e. case and adposition marking) and [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) on the verb. 1 is primarily triggered by flagging. Only if there is no overt flagging for neither the P argument nor the recipient argument, indexing is considered. 1 covers both the ‘double-object construction’ and the ‘secondary-object construction’ of Haspelmath (2013).\n\n",

Haspelmath (2016) states that \"a serial verb construction must be a productive schematic construction such that the meaning of a concrete construct can be determined on the basis of the meanings of its parts and the construction meaning.\" By contrast, verbal compounds, which are phonologically bound, are lexicalized and often non-compositional.\n\nGrambank distinguishes serial verb constructions from clause-chaining (see [GB150](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB150)). Clause chaining involves a series of verbs where only one verb is inflected. For a construction to be a serial verb construction, it must align with Haspelmath's definition and not constitute an instance of clause chaining (i.e., there is no single inflected verb while the other verbs are without inflection). Nevertheless, a language may feature both serial verb constructions and clause chaining.\n\nSerial verb constructions are also different from light verb constructions, which are made up of a verbal element and a lexical stem which is not an inflected verb, jointly determining argument structure (see [GB123](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB123)).  \n\nThe term 'verb' here refers to words that can function as independent verbs in the language under consideration. Ideally, these verbs should be dynamic, as per Haspelmath's (2016) definition: \"Verbs are defined as dynamic event expressions that do not have special coding when used in predication function\". Serial verb constructions that are more restricted, such as applying solely to stative verbs (e.g., a verb meaning 'to be good'), should not be counted as 1. Be cautious with descriptions using \"auxiliary verbs\" and \"copulas\" as these typically do not qualify as serial verb constructions.\n\n\n",

This makes light verb constructions different from serial verb constructions and verbal compounding, which involve a sequence of more than one verb. Another difference is that there is a predicate-argument relationship between the light verb and the other lexical stem (e.g. in *do baby*, *baby* is the object of *do*), while in serial verb constructions the verbs do not have a predicate-argument relationship between them since they instead describe a sequence of events. \n\n",

Therefore, I assign it to a special level of the VP called V\". The remaining particles for mode, negation, aspect, etc. are optional again. So these can be dominated by a recursive V' constituent.

Adverbs and direct object NPs are optional constituents of the VP just as in many other languages. The clitic pronoun, however, is required in every sentence (except for relative clauses, imperatives and subjectless wh-questions, cf. 3.4.1). Therefore, I assign it to a special level of the VP called V\". The remaining particles for mode, negation, aspect, etc. are optional again. So these can be dominated by a recursive V' constituent. A second and very persuasive argument that the pronoun clitics require their own V-bar constituent (here V\") is seen in the behaviour of the second person accusative pronoun clitic eel 'you', eel ul 'you (pl)', cf. example 51 below.\n(51) a. mi-sual2 in a manl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch 2ACC A criminal has caught you.\nb. mi-sual2 in a manl doonl eel man-evil ERG 3NOM catch ASP 2ACC A criminal is going to catch you.\nAt present I know of no tests to decide which of the two clitics is higher in the structure.

The adverbs are manner adverbs, adverbs of time and adverbs of place. The last two adverbs are very similar. Adverbs that precede the verb require some sort of modifier, such as the oblique marker or the locative marker. There is no such restriction on postverbal adverbs.\n\n2.5.1.1 Manner adverbs\n"

By clausal objects here we mean clauses that are directly governed by a finite verb (often verbs of ‘wanting’, ‘saying’, etc.). In other words, complement clauses are a specific type of subordinate clauses and are not relative clauses. For example, the objects in _I like **apples**_ (nominal object) and _I like **that you play the piano every morning**_ (clausal object) are in the same position (SVO). Many of the languages that do not place clausal objects in the same position as nominal objects are SOV languages that use SVO order for (long) clausal objects. This question aims to discern whether these clausal objects are treated like prototypical nominal direct objects (not indirect or obliques). This is not always explicitly stated by the descriptive work, but an investigation into the examples and perhaps even appended text of the grammar should typically reveals evidence for answering this question. \n\n",

            "summary": "Clause-chaining involves sequences of medial clauses (i.e. formally reduced or restricted clauses that do not have the full marking that usually occurs on the verb) which are dependent on a single, fully inflected verb that often (but not always) occurs in final clause. Clause chains may also be referred to as topic chains or as sequences of medial clauses/medial verbs. Crucially, this construction involves a single clause with a full, unrestricted, finite verb form and medial clauses that are dependent on it for specification of inflectional categories (e.g. TAM). \n\nClause chains are often used to describe sequences of events, and the medial verbs involved may be marked by [special affixes to indicate temporal relationships](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB152). Clause chains may also include markers of [switch reference](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB151). Medial verbs in some languages may be marked in the usual way for person/number of their arguments, though they generally lack some other canonical verbal inflection or involve specific marked verb forms that cannot be used in freestanding clauses. \n\nThere is considerable debate regarding the syntax of clause chaining generally and within individual languages. This construction is not merely a series of juxtaposed minimal clauses, as it requires dependency on one fully specified clause for full interpretation. It is also not straightforwardly a series of subordinated clauses (as in the series of temporal adjuncts in English, *Before he ate, while he was cooking the soup, he added salt.*). The syntactic relationship between clauses in clause chains is often described as a special type of coordination or a form of cosubordination.\n\nIn some cases clause-chaining may be difficult to distinguish from [serial verb constructions](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB118). Remember that a serial verb construction involves a set of verbs or verb phrases that function as a single predicate, whereas clause-chaining involves a set of *clauses* with formally reduced verbs, all dependent on a single fully specified verb form. Clause-chaining is also different from [verb compounding](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB122) in that the clauses in clause chaining are [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) and express separate propositions, which is not the case for verb compounding. In cases where it is unclear which of these constructions is represented by the examples in the grammar, a ? may be coded, but be sure to indicate in the comments that you were unable to determine which of these constructions is demonstrated in the relevant examples.\n\n",

This feature contrasts with [GB319 Is trial number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB319) which focuses on the non-bound marking of trial number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1.\n\nNumber marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writers describe the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.\n\nThe trial marker may be similar to the numeral for ‘three’, but it is crucial that it is used in a similar morphosyntactic manner to other number markers in the language.\n\n",

            "summary": "This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of paucal number on nouns (From Latin _paucalis_ ‘few, little’). Paucal is a number value that refers to a non-specified small amount usually between two or more and ten or less. The exact value can depend on what is being counted. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB320 Is paucal number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB320) which focuses on the non-bound marking of paucal number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1.\n\nNumber marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writers describe the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.\n\n",

See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the phonological properties of a noun constitute one of these factors for a given language. For this feature to be coded 1, there must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of specific phonological properties. That is, some phonological property of a noun must be one relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment. Examples of phonological properties that may play a role in gender/class assignment include tone, initial consonants, or root-final segments. Note that noun class/gender morphology may create phonological similarities across members of a certain noun class or gender; however, this is not sufficient for a 1 coding for this feature. Phonological properties must contribute to the categorization of nouns to classes/genders, rather than simply result from associated morphology.\n\n",

In languages that do not have a distinction between collective and distributive universal quantifiers (‘all’ vs. ‘every’), a quantifier that could be translated as ‘all’ and has a primarily plural use will be a sufficient target for this feature.\n\nThere are four possible codes for this feature, reflecting the fact that the collective universal quantifier might occur strictly before or strictly after the noun, may be allowed in both of these relative positions, or may not be present in a language. A 0 code is also applicable when the language does not allow a basic construction with an adnominal collective universal quantifier and a noun (e.g. if only a floating construction is used).\n\nOrders that result from constructions like quantifier float (e.g. English *The children have **all** come.*) should be disregarded for the purposes of coding this feature. \n\n",

For this feature, we are looking for a verb that expresses predicative possession where the possessor is the subject, the possessum the object and the verb is finite and clearly transitive. The finite element in itself need not be clearly distinct from an existential or locational predicator, the main difference is the argument structure. \n\nTransitivity is a language-specific category that needs to be investigated separately to learn whether or not the construction is transitive. In case of languages where transitivity is hard to define it might be beneficial to compare to verbs of holding and grasping. It is very likely that habeo-verb constructions arise from possessive constructions where the possessor is expressed as a topic.\n\n",

This feature concerns a clause which features a comitative/conjunctional construction (c.f. Stassen 2000, 2001, 2013). The predicate is an existential/locational/copula and the possessum or possessor is marked by an element marking simultaneity between clauses, or ‘also/too’, or subordinating conjunction (‘when/while’), or coordinating particle (‘and’), or a comitative marker (‘with’). The marker need not be [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence).

These markers are often described as particles in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking. \n\nThis particle does not have to be the sole marker of negation.

Mizo is no exception and I will deal very briefly with some of the verb morphology.\nTo start with, it will be useful to set up some criteria for distinguishing between particles, clitics and affixes. Zwicky (1985) has given some useful guidelines. For the time being I will distinguish between grammatical words and affixes as the latter are inflectional. Moreover, affixes\n"

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1).

In a transitive clause, the agent is marked by a case marker on the noun phrase. At the same time, the obligatory pronoun clitics in the verb phrase are organised according to nominative-accusative principles (see the preceding section and section 2.5.4.2).\n\nThe ergative case marker is a clitic and not an affix because it follows the whole noun phrase (including conjoined NPs), and is attached to whatever happens to be the last item in the noun phrase. It is optional when there are determiners. See also section 2.3.1.3.\n\n(132) a.

Furthermore, it has two phonological forms: in 1 for words and the suffix -an 1 for determiners and relative clause constructions. The ergative marker and the oblique marker are identical except for their tone (see also section 3.1.1). For example:\n(133) a. tiang inl mil vuaa\nstick OBLQ IACC beat (Someone) beat me with a stick.\nb. tni2 Je'l chang inl ka dail water and bread OBLQ INOM be satisfied I am satisfied with (just) bread and water.\nc. la-sen 1 Je'l la-pool inl kal triaal yarn-red and yam-blue OBLQ INOM stripedII I made the stripes with red and blue yam.\n\n2.6.2.4 Locative marker\n\nAs mentioned earlier (section 2.3.1.2 and 2.5.1.3), the locative marker has two basic forms: a'l for any noun and ta'lfor determiners.\n"

Other important morphological categories include demonstrative pronouns, emphatic particles and numerical expressions. These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses. This chapter will discuss the morphological categories pertaining to noun phrases.\nCase marking will be dealt w ith first, followed by a discussion o f pronominal paradigms. Noun modifiers and quantifiers follow n ex t The last section illustrates lexical nominalization.\n\nCase Marking\n\nIn a simple declarative clause the case markers are: -in ergative, -m instrumental/adverbial and -a? locative.

Indirect evidentiality usually involves inference from physical evidence or second-hand knowledge such as hearsay.

            "summary": "Are [S, A, and P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments flagged identically (i.e. are they neutrally aligned)? Flagging covers any kind of argument marking on the argument itself (e.g. by case or adposition marking). The marking can be phonologically free or bound. \nReply with 1 if none of the three arguments is overtly flagged (i.e. if all three arguments are zero-marked). In case of differential flagging systems, reply with 1 if any of the subsystems (e.g. a particular tense) shows neutral alignment. Reply with 1 if only nouns or only pronouns shows neutral alignment. Reply with 1 also if some or just one personal pronoun shows neutral alignment. Reply with 1 if a substantial class of nouns shows neutral alignment. Note that although alignment types are occasionally associated with entire languages (e.g. when one says that \"Dyirbal is an ergative language\"), they in fact apply only to individual constructions. This question asks only about the alignment of flagging, the alignment of [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or of any other construction is irrelevant for this question.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with nominal morphology, argument marking and/or basic clause structure. If no such section exists, consider examples of transitive and intransitive clauses, identify overt arguments in different roles (S, A, and P) and study their marking.\n2. Check whether any of the S, A or P arguments are flagged in any context. Consider only the major predicate class, ignore any verbs with non-canonical/special flagging (e.g. the so-called ‘dative-subject’ or experiencer verbs). Consider only independent clauses.\n3. Code 1 if there is never overt flagging of any of the three arguments S, A, and P.\n4. If there is a special flag for A or P, check whether it is used in all contexts. In particular, be aware of differences in marking conditioned by a pronoun vs. noun distinction, person, animacy, definiteness, etc. (this situation is known as differential argument marking). Code 1 even if only some pronouns or only some nouns (e.g. the indefinite ones) are identically flagged in all the three argument roles S, A, and P. If, however, a small random class of nouns is not flagged for phonological or morphological reasons, ignore this class.\n5. If there are differences in flagging conditioned by TAM distinctions, consider the distribution in individual TAM contexts. Code 1 if S, A, and P are flagged identically in some TAM categories. \n6. Code 0 if A, P or both are always marked differently than S.\n\n",

            "summary": "This feature identifies languages that do not require a phonologically overt [S or A argument](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) expressed by a noun phrase or [phonologically independent pronoun](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) when the referent can be inferred from context. These languages are often called ‘pro-drop’ languages, and the phenomenon is generally referred to as ‘null anaphora’ or ‘zero anaphora’. \n\nHere ‘omitted’ means phonologically unexpressed (we do not intend for this feature to make any distinctions regarding the theoretical status of a null argument). To count as 1, pro-drop should occur where the S or A argument might otherwise be expressed by an independent pronoun or full noun phrase. Specifically, pro-drop should occur in simple, declarative main clauses. \n\nPro-drop is not mutually exclusive with [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) of the S or A argument on the verb. If, in the absence of an independent pronoun or nominal S or A, there is indexing of this argument on the verb, you may still code 1.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. If the S or A argument may be omitted in a pragmatically unmarked main clause when its referent can be inferred from context, code 1.\n2. If the S or A argument is always phonologically expressed by a noun phrase or phonologically independent pronoun in a pragmatically unmarked main clause, code 0.\n3. If the S or A argument may be omitted in a pragmatically unmarked main clause when its referent can be inferred from context, but only if that referent represents a certain person/number category, code 1 and provide a comment that describes under what condition the S or A argument may be omitted.\n\n",
