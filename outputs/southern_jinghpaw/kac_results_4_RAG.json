These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd?

Three or more examples of indefinite/non-specific nominals occurring with an indefinite/non-specific article is sufficient to code 1. \n\nAn indefinite article is a marker that accompanies the indefinite noun and expresses notions such as non-specificity and indefiniteness. Sometimes these notions of non-specificity and indefiniteness are summed up in the term ‘identifiability’. A language does not necessarily have both a non-specific/indefinite and a specific/definite marker. These markers often stem from very different sources (numerals and demonstratives) and need not be similar in formal expression or position. \n\nThe formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone. Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm of markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum, making it hard to define discrete categories. Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning ‘a certain’. As articles necessarily accompany nouns, it is in these cases that it is necessary to investigate whether the marker can occur independently or not; if it can it is most likely a pronoun and not an article. Articles can be homophonous with pronouns and demonstratives, and also with classifiers.\n\n",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.5 Nominalization and subordination\nThe pervasive use and multifunctionality of clausal nominalization is a prominent feature of Jinghpaw grammar. Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d?

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37).

This feature has also been split into two binary features, \"GB024a Is the order of the numeral and noun Num-N?\" and \"GB024b Is the order of the numeral and noun N-Num?\". It is possible to answer 1 or 0 for one of the binarised features, and \"?\" for the other.\n\nIn some languages only one order (Numeral-Noun or Noun-Numeral) is possible. In other languages, both orders may be possible. This can take the form of free variation (where Numeral-Noun and Noun-Numeral order can occur interchangeably). The order may also depend on some other grammatical category which is neutral with respect to pragmaticality (e.g. definiteness). If the order depends on the noun, consider only the orders that apply to an open class of nouns and disregard orders that are restricted to a specific closed class of nouns.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Consider only phrases with the meaning 'X (numeral) units of Y (noun)' in their pragmatically neutral form. It does not matter what kind of construction is required (e.g. attributive *two books* or relative *books that are two*) or what word class the root or modifying form of the cardinal numerals belongs to, e.g. *two-ing books* (verb) or *two-some books* (noun) apply to this question.\n2. If the numeral always precedes the noun, code 1 for GB024 or 1 for GB024a. \n3. If the numeral always follows the noun, code 2 for GB024 or 1 for GB024b\n4. If a closed class of nouns requires a different order than an open class, disregard the closed class and code the order that applies to the open class.\n5. If both orders occur for an open class of nouns, that is if some numerals precede and some follow, or there is a free choice or there is a choice depending on some other factor (e.g. definiteness), code 3 for GB024 or 1 for GB024a and GB024b.\n\n",
            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2 The noun phrase\n\nWithin an np, genitive and relative modifiers occur in the pre-head position, while modi­ fiers such as an adjective, plural marker ni, numeral and classifier occur in the post-head position, as in (4). A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’\n\ne. ei? ga-phii ‘his/her brother’ f. eanthe ?a? ga-phu ‘their brother’\n\n5.2.3 Numerals and classifiers\n\nJinghpaw has a decimal numeral system, as is the case with many other TB languages. Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/hertz_kachin1902_o.txt'}\nADVERBIAL NUMERALS.\n45. Firstly, secondly, &c., are expressed in the following manner :—•\nBy adding gaw to shawng or shawng de (before), or to hpang or hpangde htawrn or htawrn de (behind).\nShawng de gaw = firstly. Hpang de gaw = lastly, but following the first it would mean\nsecondly. Hpang de gaw, following the numerals, three, four, &c., would\nmean fourthly, fifthly, &c. Twice, thrice, &c., are commonly expressed by adding lang (occasion or repetition of any thing) to the ordinal numbers as lakhawng lang twice or two times, masum lang, thrice or three times, &c, Once is expressed by langmiov kalangmi from lang and mi {see section) 43). It is never expressed by adding lang\\x> the numeral one.\n\nPREPOSITIONS.\n\n46. Prepositions follow the nouns they refer to—\n\nHpe (abbreviated form e) ... ‘to’ (dative particle).\n\n* De (abbreviated form e)\n\n... ‘to,’ ‘in,’ or ‘at’ a place (loca­ tive).\n\nKaw ...\n\n...\n\n... ‘to’ and is used with reference to\n\npersons in the same manner as\n\nde (to) with reference to\n\nn 13 p p c\n\n* Na ...\n\n...\n\n... ‘from,’‘of,’ ‘out of.’\n\nHta ...\n\n....\n\n... ‘in-’\n\nHte ...\n\n..-\n\n... ‘with’ (used as a conjunction\n\n‘ and ’).\n\nMakau ...\n\n...\n\n... ‘by,’ ‘near.’\n\nExamples.\nNgai hpe shi hpa n jaw ai = He gave nothing to me. Mare de kakat sa u — Run to the village. Nta de kadai mung n nga ai = There is nobody in the house. Shanhte ga law yang gaw ngai manau manau de n nga ai — I\nwas not at the dance when they quarrelled. Wora du wa kaw sa shawk u = Go and report to that chief.\n\n* The verb determines whether de is to, in or at', and when na is from, of or out of-\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.5 Nominalization and subordination\nThe pervasive use and multifunctionality of clausal nominalization is a prominent feature of Jinghpaw grammar. Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d?

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow.

            "summary": "This feature describes an adnominal property word denoting core adjectival concepts such as shape, value, dimension, age, color (at a minimum -- many other meanings are possible) which can be separated from the noun it modifies by some element that is not part of the nominal phrase. For example, can you say ***the man** is running **big*** to mean ‘**the big man** is running’? \n\nTypically a language which allows this has extensive [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) systems so that you can still work out what modifies what in the NP without them being adjacent (e.g. the ‘Australian type’). NPs that are made up of several coordinated NPs that can be interpreted by the verb or other elements are not relevant here. This features aims specifically to capture the phenomenon of a single NP whose property words can occur outside of and not immediately adjacent to the portion of the NP that contains the head. Examples of the type *I painted the house red* or *I saw the boy big* are not necessarily discontinuous, but most likely resultative or contrastive (*I saw the boy big* [as opposed to before when he was small]). These should be disregarded for the purposes of this feature.\n\nNote that for the purposes of this feature only property words (e.g. *tall*, *red*, *friendly*) should be considered. Any other elements described as 'adjectives' or 'adjectival' in the grammatical description (e.g. quantifiers, demonstratives) should be disregarded in coding this feature.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Code 1 if there are any sentences illustrating noun phrases where the adnominal property word is separated from the noun phrase whose head it modifies, such as *The man is running big.* to mean ‘The big man is running.’\n2. Ignore sentences which may be resultatives such as *I painted the house red.* or contrastives such as *I saw the boy big.* (when he was an adult).\n3. Code 1 if the grammar specifically states that the language allows adnominal property words to occur in a position separated from the remainder of the nominal phrase whose head they modify.\n4. If discontinuous adnominal property words are not mentioned and there are no example sentences that show this phenomenon, code 0.\n5. If there is an extensive agreement system, exhaust all resources to discover whether discontinuous adnominal property words are possible, even if they are not mentioned in the grammar. If you are uncertain whether their omission from a grammar truly indicates their absence in a language with an extensive agreement system you may code ? and include a comment about the lack of evidence.\n\n",

                "content": "5.5 Nominalization and subordination\nThe pervasive use and multifunctionality of clausal nominalization is a prominent feature of Jinghpaw grammar. Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d?

In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

            "summary": "Is there a difference between the marking of NP coordination (*John **and** Mary went to market.*) and the marking of comitative phrases (*John **with** Mary went to market.*)? In some languages the only way to coordinate noun phrases is with a comitative phrase, i.e. the only way to say ‘X **and** Y’ is ‘X **with** Y’. To see whether an element is comitative or coordinating you can check case marking and agreement. For example, if X is the element in question and in the dative you get ‘John-DAT X Mary-DAT’, then X is likely coordinating. If you get ‘John-DAT X Mary’, X is likely comitative. If there is agreement, if you get ‘John X Mary verb-PL’ rather than 'John X Mary verb-SG' (just like ‘John X suitcase verb-SG’), this suggests that X is coordinating.\n\n",

Code 1 if there is an example of NP coordination (e.g. *John **and** Mary went to the market*) which uses an element that is distinct from the comitative marker (e.g. *John went to the market **with** Mary.*). \n3. Code 0 if a grammar states that the language uses the same elements to coordinate NPs and to mark comitative phrases.\n4. Grammars do not always explicitly state whether or not the same element is used for comitative marking and nominal conjunction. Look for examples in example sentences and in appended texts as well as in the prose of the grammar.\n\n",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d?

In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n998 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\n(a, below), distributivity (b), indefiniteness (c), and plurality of demonstratives (d). Redu­ plication can be employed to form adverbs or adverbial clauses as well (e, f). Related to this is the reduplication-like noun-verb construction which may involve loanwords, such as damyaP mya? ‘rob’ (< Burmese damya ‘robber’) and lawban ban ‘become a boss’ (< Chinese laoban ‘boss’). Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit?

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’\n\n5.2.4 Interrogative pronouns\nMost Jinghpaw interrogatives are analyzable into an element ga- and following mor­ phemes. Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.\n"

When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n"

For the purposes of this feature we define third person pronouns as including demonstratives. A masculine/feminine distinction is commonly encoded in third person pronouns, but distinctions in any other noun class/gender categories such as animacy also satisfy the criterion for coding a 1 for this feature. For languages with no third person independent pronouns or no noun class/gender distinctions in third person pronouns, a gender distinction in demonstratives would be sufficient to trigger a 1 here. If pronouns with just inanimate referents (or alternatively, just animate referents) agree with the noun class/gender of the corresponding noun that also suffices for 1. If a language has any gender distinction for third person pronouns but not for demonstratives, this is also sufficient for a 1.

If pronouns are used only for animate third person referents and demonstratives are used for inanimate third person referents, but no noun class/gender contrasts are encoded within the third person pronouns nor within the set of demonstratives, this can be interpreted as an animacy contrast in third person pro-forms and is sufficient for 1 coding.\n5.

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Only proximal demonstratives may be used for anaphora or cataphora.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/hertz_kachin1902_o.txt'}\nExamples.\n\nNang a nt a kaba ai— Your bouse is large; but it may be used after the word denoting the thing possessed as follows:\n\nWora nta kaba nang a re =That big house is yours.\n2\n\n\f( IO )\n\n32. The demonstrative pronouns are—\n\nNdai = This-\n\nWora = That (denoting an object on the same level as the\n\n’\n\nspeaker).\n\n= That (denoting an object on a higher place than the\n\nspeaker).\n\nLera = That (denoting an object on a lower place than the\n\nspeaker).\n\n33. Demonstrative pronouns precede the words denoting the things de­ monstrated.\n\nExamples.\n\nNdai num kasha tsawm rt?'=This girl is pretty. Lera khauna makau = Near that paddy field.\n34. Ndai, wora, htora and lera are used in the plural as well as the singular.\nWo, hto and le are abbreviated forms of wora, htora and lera, and when used are as a rule followed by de (signifying place) or na (from).\n\nExamples.\n\nWo de nga = That bullock. Le na masha — That man (literally, the man from that place).\nNdai is frequently abbreviated to dai, thereby lessening its emphasis.\n\nExamples.\n\nDai ni — To-day.

For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n"

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case.

We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nverbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/hertz_kachin1902_o.txt'}\n(5 )\n6. Many nouns are formed from verbal roots by the aid of certain pre­ fixes, as abawng, a prisoner, from bawng to confine ; nsa breath, from so. to breathe ; makham, a trap, from kharn to trap, &c.\n7. Compound nouns are formed by uniting nouns as shanhpi, leather, from shdn a common term for wild animals and hpi the skin, and by other combinations which are self-explanatory, as dut aiwa, the seller, from dut ai to sell and wa a person, &c.\n8. Monosyllabic nouns are frequently prefixed by a. Example : ja dja, gold ; na, dna, elder sister.\n(zz) When terms of relationship are prefixed by ning or n, their re­ lation to a second person is indicated. Example : hpu, elder brother; mighpu or nhpu, the elder brother of the person spoken to.\n(£) When prefixed by ka, their relation to a third person is indicat­ ed. Example : nau, younger brother ; kanau, the younger brother of the person spoken of.\nThe prefix kd is occasionally used in place of ning or n. It is, strictly speaking, incorrect to do so and its use in this manner should be avoided.\n(c) The prefixes ning, n and kd are used only with monosyllabic terms of relationship.\nForming the Plural.\n9. A general plural is most commonly formed by adding wz’tothe noun. Example : ma a child, ma ni children ; kumra a pony, kumra ni ponies.\n10. The plural is implied when nouns are followed by adjectives like all, some, many, and the numerals and the plural sign ni can be omitted.\nExamples.\nGwiyawngwau ai = All dogs (literally ‘dog’) bark. Nlong nkau grai ja ai = Some stones are very hard. Sdnat khun=Twenty guns. 11. The plural affix ni may, however, be used with adjectives that imply the plural.\nExamples.\nChingpaw nkau ) =Sorae men. Chingpaw nt nkau j 12. When a numeral follows a noun the affix ni is not used, except if the numeral be qualified by ddram or taram. (about), when the affix may be used.\nExamples.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n998 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\n(a, below), distributivity (b), indefiniteness (c), and plurality of demonstratives (d). Redu­ plication can be employed to form adverbs or adverbial clauses as well (e, f). Related to this is the reduplication-like noun-verb construction which may involve loanwords, such as damyaP mya? ‘rob’ (< Burmese damya ‘robber’) and lawban ban ‘become a boss’ (< Chinese laoban ‘boss’). Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit?

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n"

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1.\n\nNumber marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class.

Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB317 Is dual number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?\n](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB317) which focuses on the non-bound marking of dual number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1. \n\nNumber marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular. \n\nIt can be difficult to determine how obligatory markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writer describes the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.\n\n",

            "summary": "This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of plural number on nouns. This feature contrasts with [GB318\tIs plural number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB318) which focuses on non-bound marking of plural number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1. Reduplication (full or partial) does not count for this feature.\n\nThe marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. Classes of animate nouns or human nouns are large and open enough. Kinship terms however are a restricted set since it is very hard to add new members.\n\nNumber marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.\n\n",

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form. For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case.

Note that the 2nd person prefix h- apparently came from nay ‘you’ or\n\nTABLE 53.4 PROPERTIES OF NOUN SUBCLASSES\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) 00 (f) (g) (h) (0 (i)\n\ncommon nouns\n\nyes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes some\n\nnumerals\n\nyes yes yes no yes yes yes yes no yes\n\ndemonstratives\n\nyes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\npersonal pronouns\n\nyes yes some yes no no no no no no\n\ninterrogative pronouns yes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\nlocator nouns\n\nyes yes no\n\nno yes yes yes no no no\n\npostpositions\n\nyes no no\n\nno yes yes yes no no some\n\n\f1000 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS\n\nSingular ( n o m )\n\nSingular ( g e n )\n\n1st\n\nnay\n\n2nd\n\nnag\n\n3rd\n\nei\n\nnye? na? ei?\n\nDual\nPan nan ean\n\nPlural\n?anlhe nanthe eanthe\n\nna? ‘your.’ Less apparent, the 3rd person prefix ga- seems to have a historical connection to the 3rd person pronoun which is pronounced khyi in some Jinghpaw varieties (Dai and Xu 1992: 23), suggesting a sound change *khyi > ei in Standard Jinghpaw.\n\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form. For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/hertz_kachin1902_o.txt'}\n(5 )\n6. Many nouns are formed from verbal roots by the aid of certain pre­ fixes, as abawng, a prisoner, from bawng to confine ; nsa breath, from so. to breathe ; makham, a trap, from kharn to trap, &c.\n7. Compound nouns are formed by uniting nouns as shanhpi, leather, from shdn a common term for wild animals and hpi the skin, and by other combinations which are self-explanatory, as dut aiwa, the seller, from dut ai to sell and wa a person, &c.\n8. Monosyllabic nouns are frequently prefixed by a. Example : ja dja, gold ; na, dna, elder sister.\n(zz) When terms of relationship are prefixed by ning or n, their re­ lation to a second person is indicated. Example : hpu, elder brother; mighpu or nhpu, the elder brother of the person spoken to.\n(£) When prefixed by ka, their relation to a third person is indicat­ ed. Example : nau, younger brother ; kanau, the younger brother of the person spoken of.\nThe prefix kd is occasionally used in place of ning or n. It is, strictly speaking, incorrect to do so and its use in this manner should be avoided.\n(c) The prefixes ning, n and kd are used only with monosyllabic terms of relationship.\nForming the Plural.\n9. A general plural is most commonly formed by adding wz’tothe noun. Example : ma a child, ma ni children ; kumra a pony, kumra ni ponies.\n10. The plural is implied when nouns are followed by adjectives like all, some, many, and the numerals and the plural sign ni can be omitted.\nExamples.\nGwiyawngwau ai = All dogs (literally ‘dog’) bark. Nlong nkau grai ja ai = Some stones are very hard. Sdnat khun=Twenty guns. 11. The plural affix ni may, however, be used with adjectives that imply the plural.\nExamples.\nChingpaw nkau ) =Sorae men. Chingpaw nt nkau j 12. When a numeral follows a noun the affix ni is not used, except if the numeral be qualified by ddram or taram. (about), when the affix may be used.\nExamples.\n"

For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . .

These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’.

When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion.

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

The nominalization strategy may also derive other types of nominalization. A compound of a verb root and a noun meaning 'thing' is not an object nominalization unless there is evidence that the noun has grammaticalized into an affix. Instrument derivations are not relevant since they do not denote the object resulting from the action/state.\n\n",

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 405\nfood’, ‘leftovers’; likewise, [luʔ 31] ‘to drink’ follows [khaʔ 31] water in [luʔ 31khaʔ 31] ‘drinking water’. In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.4.2 Verb serialization\n\nJinghpaw verbs can be serialized productively, without any overt marker o f coordination or subordination, constituting a single predicate. Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a? Pay.\n\nsun-people pi only first know dance pl-3rd decl\n\n‘The first time, only people of the sun are able to dance the Manau dance.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n998 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\n(a, below), distributivity (b), indefiniteness (c), and plurality of demonstratives (d).

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below.

The common plural sign ni may or may not be used with them.\nExamples.\nWora laguyan myit rau ai = Both those thieves are of one mind. Shan ma ni kahsup nga ai = Those two children are playing. 15. The addition of hie or hteng {see Pronouns) to the dual pronouns makes the number in the plural three or more.\nExamples.\nAn, we two ; Anhte, we (three or more). Nan, you two\\ Nanhte, you (three or more). Shan, they two ; Shanhte (three or more).\nGender.\n16. The masculine or feminine gender of individuals of the human fami­ ly is distinguished by different words, such as—\nSabrang = A lad, a young unmarried man, Makhavon = A maid, a young unmarried woman, Tingla = An old man, Kumgai ■ An old woman, Sinkra — A widower, Kaita or Kaina = A widow, and by most of the terms of relationship.\n17. The gender is also distinguished by placing la or lasha. for the male and num or numsha for the female before words of common gender.\nShadang and shayi for male and female are used likewise. Kdsha = A child. La kdsha = K male child. Num kdsha = A female child. Shadang sha = K son. Shayi sha = K daughter.\n17 (a). A lusty young man is sometimes called a gwila. There is no feminine term corresponding to gwila.\n18. But in the case of proper nouns of common gender the words la and num denoting the gender follow the noun as a rule.\nExamples.\nMyen la = A. Burman. Myen num=h Burmese woman.\n10. Wa for the masculine andjan for the feminine which are as often used as la and num always follow nouns of common gender.\nExamples.\nKdnau = Meaning a younger brother or sister. Kanau w« = Younger brother. Kanau jan = Younger sister. Muwa wa = Chinaman. Muvoa jan = Chinese woman.\n\n\f( 7 )\n\n20. The gender of the inferior animals is distinguished by affixing to the noun la for males and yi for females.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n\nIn contrast to common nouns, which take a full range of adnominals, closed classes of nouns cannot take the same range of adnominals. Demonstratives and personal pronouns, for example, only allow post-adnominals. Table 53.4 summarizes the properties of noun sub­ classes in terms of whether a given noun: (a) can be the head of an np; (b) can occur on its own; (c) can be pluralized by the plural marker; (d) can be quantified by a numeral; (e) can be determinated by a pre-head demonstrative; (f) can be preceded by a relative clause; (g) can be preceded by a genitive phrase; (h) can be determinated by a post-head demonstra­ tive; (i) can be modified by an adjective; or (j) can be involved in partial reduplication.\n\n5.2.1 Demonstratives\nJinghpaw demonstratives are distinguished in terms of speaker/addressee orientation, rel­ ative distance, and height from the speaker: nday [proximal; speaker-centered]; day [proximal; addressee-centered]; wd-ra [distal; level]; tho-ra [distal; up]; le-ra [distal; down], the latter three of which involve eara ‘place.’Demonstratives may occur in pre- or post-head positions, except when they modify locator nouns or postpositions, in which case only pre-head position is grammatical. Only proximal demonstratives may be used for anaphora or cataphora.\n"

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form. For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nThe Jinghpaw person indexation system is based on both grammatical roles and a person hierarchy in which SAPs outrank a 3rd person (SAP > 3rd). Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.2 Personalpronouns\nThe personal pronoun system exhibits three-way splits in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural), yielding the paradigm given in Table 53.5. There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking. Note that the 2nd person prefix h- apparently came from nay ‘you’ or\n\nTABLE 53.4 PROPERTIES OF NOUN SUBCLASSES\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) 00 (f) (g) (h) (0 (i)\n\ncommon nouns\n\nyes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes some\n\nnumerals\n\nyes yes yes no yes yes yes yes no yes\n\ndemonstratives\n\nyes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\npersonal pronouns\n\nyes yes some yes no no no no no no\n\ninterrogative pronouns yes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\nlocator nouns\n\nyes yes no\n\nno yes yes yes no no no\n\npostpositions\n\nyes no no\n\nno yes yes yes no no some\n\n\f1000 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS\n\nSingular ( n o m )\n\nSingular ( g e n )\n\n1st\n\nnay\n\n2nd\n\nnag\n\n3rd\n\nei\n\nnye? na? ei?\n\nDual\nPan nan ean\n\nPlural\n?anlhe nanthe eanthe\n\nna? ‘your.’ Less apparent, the 3rd person prefix ga- seems to have a historical connection to the 3rd person pronoun which is pronounced khyi in some Jinghpaw varieties (Dai and Xu 1992: 23), suggesting a sound change *khyi > ei in Standard Jinghpaw.\n\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2 The noun phrase\n\nWithin an np, genitive and relative modifiers occur in the pre-head position, while modi­ fiers such as an adjective, plural marker ni, numeral and classifier occur in the post-head position, as in (4). A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n"

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun.

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n\nIn contrast to common nouns, which take a full range of adnominals, closed classes of nouns cannot take the same range of adnominals. Demonstratives and personal pronouns, for example, only allow post-adnominals. Table 53.4 summarizes the properties of noun sub­ classes in terms of whether a given noun: (a) can be the head of an np; (b) can occur on its own; (c) can be pluralized by the plural marker; (d) can be quantified by a numeral; (e) can be determinated by a pre-head demonstrative; (f) can be preceded by a relative clause; (g) can be preceded by a genitive phrase; (h) can be determinated by a post-head demonstra­ tive; (i) can be modified by an adjective; or (j) can be involved in partial reduplication.\n\n5.2.1 Demonstratives\nJinghpaw demonstratives are distinguished in terms of speaker/addressee orientation, rel­ ative distance, and height from the speaker: nday [proximal; speaker-centered]; day [proximal; addressee-centered]; wd-ra [distal; level]; tho-ra [distal; up]; le-ra [distal; down], the latter three of which involve eara ‘place.’Demonstratives may occur in pre- or post-head positions, except when they modify locator nouns or postpositions, in which case only pre-head position is grammatical. Only proximal demonstratives may be used for anaphora or cataphora.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/hertz_kachin1902_o.txt'}\n(5 )\n6. Many nouns are formed from verbal roots by the aid of certain pre­ fixes, as abawng, a prisoner, from bawng to confine ; nsa breath, from so. to breathe ; makham, a trap, from kharn to trap, &c.\n7. Compound nouns are formed by uniting nouns as shanhpi, leather, from shdn a common term for wild animals and hpi the skin, and by other combinations which are self-explanatory, as dut aiwa, the seller, from dut ai to sell and wa a person, &c.\n8. Monosyllabic nouns are frequently prefixed by a. Example : ja dja, gold ; na, dna, elder sister.\n(zz) When terms of relationship are prefixed by ning or n, their re­ lation to a second person is indicated. Example : hpu, elder brother; mighpu or nhpu, the elder brother of the person spoken to.\n(£) When prefixed by ka, their relation to a third person is indicat­ ed. Example : nau, younger brother ; kanau, the younger brother of the person spoken of.\nThe prefix kd is occasionally used in place of ning or n. It is, strictly speaking, incorrect to do so and its use in this manner should be avoided.\n(c) The prefixes ning, n and kd are used only with monosyllabic terms of relationship.\nForming the Plural.\n9. A general plural is most commonly formed by adding wz’tothe noun. Example : ma a child, ma ni children ; kumra a pony, kumra ni ponies.\n10. The plural is implied when nouns are followed by adjectives like all, some, many, and the numerals and the plural sign ni can be omitted.\nExamples.\nGwiyawngwau ai = All dogs (literally ‘dog’) bark. Nlong nkau grai ja ai = Some stones are very hard. Sdnat khun=Twenty guns. 11. The plural affix ni may, however, be used with adjectives that imply the plural.\nExamples.\nChingpaw nkau ) =Sorae men. Chingpaw nt nkau j 12. When a numeral follows a noun the affix ni is not used, except if the numeral be qualified by ddram or taram. (about), when the affix may be used.\nExamples.\n"

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case.

When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

As an example, if the language forms modifying verbs by participles ('the running man') and this is similarly applied for adnominal property word roots ('the redding man'), including their relativized forms, this counts as 1.\n\n",

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n998 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\n(a, below), distributivity (b), indefiniteness (c), and plurality of demonstratives (d). Redu­ plication can be employed to form adverbs or adverbial clauses as well (e, f). Related to this is the reduplication-like noun-verb construction which may involve loanwords, such as damyaP mya? ‘rob’ (< Burmese damya ‘robber’) and lawban ban ‘become a boss’ (< Chinese laoban ‘boss’). Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit? [rain-REDUP]\n\n‘whether it rains’\n\n5 SYNTAX\n5.1 Word classes\nThis chapter divides Jinghpaw words into the following five word classes: nouns, verbs, adverbs, particles, and interjections. Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form. For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover\n"

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.2 Personalpronouns\nThe personal pronoun system exhibits three-way splits in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural), yielding the paradigm given in Table 53.5.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form. For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n"

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

This relationship could be circumstantial (e.g. locative, temporal, etc.) or a [core argument function (S, A or P)](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)). A preposition precedes the noun phrase it occurs with. Proclitics with this function count as prepositions in Grambank. This means that [phonological boundness](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) is not relevant to this question. Circumpositions count both as prepositions and as postpositions. Inpositions (which occur somewhere in between words in a noun phrase) do not count as prepositions. Nouns that express the function of an adposition in a possessive construction (e.g. ***inside** of the car* to mean 'in the car') only count if they are visibly grammaticalized and no longer fully behave like nouns. If there is only one preposition, this is enough for a 1 here.\n\n",

Circumpositions count as both postpositions and prepositions. Inpositions (which occur somewhere in between words in a noun phrase) do not count as postpositions. Nouns that express the function of an adposition in a possessive construction (e.g. ***inside** of the car* to mean 'in the car') only count if they are visibly grammaticalized and no longer fully behave like nouns.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2 The noun phrase\n\nWithin an np, genitive and relative modifiers occur in the pre-head position, while modi­ fiers such as an adjective, plural marker ni, numeral and classifier occur in the post-head position, as in (4). A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 407\n\nmodify ordinary verbs; they modify only certain generalised verbs (GVs) such as [ti33], [ ai31], [ŋa33], [ŋu55] and [ e33].\n\n(1) ʃi33 ŋjan31\n\nai31 wa31 mat31\n\nsai33\n\n3SG dilly-dally GV return completive SFW\n\n‘He took his time going back.’\n\n(2) n31luŋ31 theʔ 31 mjet55\n\nti33 kW31mjet55\n\nstone INST press-press GV press\n\n‘Press it with the stone really hard!’\n\nton31\n\nuʔ 31\n\nleave (in a place) SFW\n\nPostpositions are structural particles such as [eʔ 55], [aʔ 31] and [e31] used following objects, adnominal modifiers, and other constituents to mark relationships among sentence constituents, as in the following examples.\n\n(3) ŋai33 ʃi33 eʔ 55 ja33 sW33ŋai33 1SG 3SG OBJ give SFW ‘I gave it to him.’\n\n(4) ŋai33-nau33\n\naʔ 31 lai31ka33\n\n1SGPOSS-younger.brother GEN book\n\n‘My younger brother’s book.’\n\n(5) ʃW31wa31mW31ʃa31 e31\n\nim31 ton31\n\nthe.masses\n\nAGT capture set down and leave [in a fixed place]\n\n‘To be seized by the masses.’\n\nThe SFW has numerous inflected forms.

These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template.

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’.

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 405\nfood’, ‘leftovers’; likewise, [luʔ 31] ‘to drink’ follows [khaʔ 31] water in [luʔ 31khaʔ 31] ‘drinking water’. In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.\n"

They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n"

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Note that the terms 'stem' and 'infix' may be used differently across some grammar writing traditions, so care must be taken to examine the structure of relevant forms rather than relying on the use of these terms. Here we are interested in infixes that occur internal to the base form of a verb that is held in common across inflected forms (called the 'stem' here), rather than affixes that occur between a verb's root or stem and some inflectional affix(es) or clitic(s).\n\n\n",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun.

            "question": "Is there overt morphological marking of present tense on verbs?",
            "summary": "This question aims to capture productive paradigms of overt tense marking. 'Morphological marking on the verb' means that the marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verb. The marking of tense can involve affixes, clitics, suppletion, tonal marking and/or reduplication. This feature aims to capture overt marking of present tense on the verb. Lack of other marking is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example some grammarians state that present tense is expressed by a certain aspect on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing present tense then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB082) and the feature on tense auxiliaries ([GB121](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB121)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing present tense, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.\n\nSometimes a language is described as having a past/non-past distinction. In this case, if there is an overt marker of non-past code the language as 1 for this feature (GB082), but 0 for the feature on future tense [GB084](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB084). Future tense needs to be more dedicated to actual future reference, whereas present tense has less strict demands on the scope of its function. This situation is mirrored for future/non-future which results in a 1 for GB082 and GB084 but a 0 for GB083 (if both have over markers). It is however not acceptable for a present tense marker to occur in both future and past contexts.\n\nIf there is a tense system with a \"hodiernal\" category, i.e \"the day of speaking\", that also includes past events of the same day, this is permissible to code as a present tense marker.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Find the section discussing tense in the grammatical description.\n2. If present tense is not explicitly defined, check the description of the other tenses (if there are any).\n3. Code 1 if present tense can be marked on the verb by an affix or clitic, suppletion, tonal marking or reduplication.\n4. Code 1 if present tense can be marked by a combination of morphology and an auxiliary or particle. In these cases, also code 1 for [GB121](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB121) on tense auxiliaries and/or [GB521](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB521) on tense particles.\n4. If present tense is only marked by the absence of other markers, code 0.\n5. If the language is described as having a non-past tense and it is overtly marked, code it as 1 for this feature (GB082), but as 0 for the feature on future tense marking [GB084](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB084). (Granted that marking is morphological, not with a free-standing marker.)\n\n",

As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person.

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a? Pay.\n\nsun-people pi only first know dance pl-3rd decl\n\n‘The first time, only people of the sun are able to dance the Manau dance.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above.

Future tense needs to be more dedicated to actual future reference, whereas present tense has less strict demands on the scope of its function.\n\nIt can be hard to distinguish future tense from different modal categories, after all if something is in the future it has not yet occurred and can be construed as something wished for, planned, intended, etc. For this reason, it is necessary to pay particular attention to sections on mood, especially irrealis, when coding for future tense.\n\nIf a language only has future tense under negation, this does not count for this feature. It needs to be present for affirmation as well. The reason for this is that conditions such as 'only under negation' are likely to give rise to quite different analysis by different linguists (hence it is hard to ensure comparability) and might also be overlooked.

Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n(13) a. sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nb. sa\n\ns-it-0.\n\ngo/come VEN-2nd-iMP go/come AND-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here!’\n\n‘Go away!’\n\nOther morphemes that occupy the same slot include /- ‘pa’ and n- ‘intns.’The morpheme /- ‘pa’ is used to signal agreement with a possessor of an argument, as in (10). Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1006 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nspeaker puts one participant in focus, while the latter is used when the speaker focuses on two participants (Scott DeLancey, personal communication).

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.4.2 Verb serialization\n\nJinghpaw verbs can be serialized productively, without any overt marker o f coordination or subordination, constituting a single predicate. Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

These categories could go by the name of punctual and continuous, preterit and progressive, etc. The answer could be 1 even if only one of these is overtly marked, e.g. if the imperfective is marked by an affix and the perfective is marked by an auxiliary. \n\nThere are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that the imperfective aspect is expressed by a certain form on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing imperfective aspect then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB086) and the feature on aspectual auxiliaries ([GB120](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB120) and/or [GB520](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB520)).

Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n"

If there is some variation in the position of the S index conditioned by the verb (e.g. most verbs code the S argument with a suffix, but a couple use a prefix, this might be the case in the so-called split-S/stative-active languages), consider only the patterns which occur with large classes of verbs.\n4. If the verb shows overt indexing only with some arguments (e.g. only with animate arguments or only with first person singular arguments, the situation known as differential argument indexing), this still counts as 1.\n5.

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n998 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\n(a, below), distributivity (b), indefiniteness (c), and plurality of demonstratives (d).

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n"

Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.4.2 Verb serialization\n\nJinghpaw verbs can be serialized productively, without any overt marker o f coordination or subordination, constituting a single predicate. Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a? Pay.\n\nsun-people pi only first know dance pl-3rd decl\n\n‘The first time, only people of the sun are able to dance the Manau dance.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs.

Variations in marking strategies include both variations in the alignment patterns and variations in position (e.g. suffixing vs. prefixing) in case of indexes. This question includes some of the cases referred to as (alignment) split in the literature. \nMerely different allomorphs of person/number indexes in the same position do not count. \nPolarity (i.e. positive vs. negative distinction) does not count as a TAM category. \nAny variation of indexing in the imperative does not count either.\n\n",

Is there any variation in the flagging of either S, A, or P which is determined by TAM categories (e.g. certain cases are used only in the perfective but not in the imperfective)? Code 1 if this is the case. Specifically look for such terms as *split ergative/ergativity* and *differential subject marking*.\n2. Consider the indexing patterns of the language (coded in [GB089](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB089)–[GB094](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB409)). Is there any variation in the indexing of either S, A, or P which is determined by TAM categories? Code 1 for any difference in the form of the respective markers if this result in different alignment patterns. Also code 1 for variation in the position of indexes (prefix/proclitic vs. suffix/clitic), even if the overall alignment pattern remains the same.\n3. Code 0 if there is no variation in indexing or flagging according to TAM distinctions.\n4. Code 0 if TAM marking results in merely different allomorphs of person/number indexes in the same position, so that both the overall alignment pattern and the position of markers remain the same.

Look for cases of *non-canonical argument marking* and consider the respective verb classes.\n4.

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person.

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below.

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1).

This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nThe Jinghpaw person indexation system is based on both grammatical roles and a person hierarchy in which SAPs outrank a 3rd person (SAP > 3rd). Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n(13) a. sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nb. sa\n\ns-it-0.\n\ngo/come VEN-2nd-iMP go/come AND-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here!’\n\n‘Go away!’\n\nOther morphemes that occupy the same slot include /- ‘pa’ and n- ‘intns.’The morpheme /- ‘pa’ is used to signal agreement with a possessor of an argument, as in (10). Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.2 Personalpronouns\nThe personal pronoun system exhibits three-way splits in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural), yielding the paradigm given in Table 53.5. There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking. Note that the 2nd person prefix h- apparently came from nay ‘you’ or\n\nTABLE 53.4 PROPERTIES OF NOUN SUBCLASSES\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) 00 (f) (g) (h) (0 (i)\n\ncommon nouns\n\nyes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes some\n\nnumerals\n\nyes yes yes no yes yes yes yes no yes\n\ndemonstratives\n\nyes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\npersonal pronouns\n\nyes yes some yes no no no no no no\n\ninterrogative pronouns yes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\nlocator nouns\n\nyes yes no\n\nno yes yes yes no no no\n\npostpositions\n\nyes no no\n\nno yes yes yes no no some\n\n\f1000 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS\n\nSingular ( n o m )\n\nSingular ( g e n )\n\n1st\n\nnay\n\n2nd\n\nnag\n\n3rd\n\nei\n\nnye? na? ei?\n\nDual\nPan nan ean\n\nPlural\n?anlhe nanthe eanthe\n\nna? ‘your.’ Less apparent, the 3rd person prefix ga- seems to have a historical connection to the 3rd person pronoun which is pronounced khyi in some Jinghpaw varieties (Dai and Xu 1992: 23), suggesting a sound change *khyi > ei in Standard Jinghpaw.\n\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’\n"

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template.

Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person.

The marker could be analyzed in the language-specific case as voice, [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or a 'bound pronoun'. In some languages, applicative markers may be used to topicalize, focalize or background a beneficiary. This type of marking also counts for this feature. The marker does not have to index the beneficiary. Autobenefactive markers do not count and serial verb constructions that include a benefactive verb (typically 'give') do not count. \n\n",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person.

In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n"

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n(13) a. sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nb. sa\n\ns-it-0.\n\ngo/come VEN-2nd-iMP go/come AND-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here!’\n\n‘Go away!’\n\nOther morphemes that occupy the same slot include /- ‘pa’ and n- ‘intns.’The morpheme /- ‘pa’ is used to signal agreement with a possessor of an argument, as in (10). Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person.

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nThe Jinghpaw person indexation system is based on both grammatical roles and a person hierarchy in which SAPs outrank a 3rd person (SAP > 3rd). Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

An example of this is English *went* and *go*. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. Only strong suppletion (different stems) counts, ‘weak’ suppletion is not included.

Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood.

Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion.

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship.

The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’.

For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event; goal of movement; possessor\n\ntha? locative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event; goal of movement; standard of\n\ncomparison\n\n?e\n\nlocative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event\n\nde? allative\n\ngoal of movement; location of existence and event; time of event\n\nhna ablative\n\nsource of movement; location of emergence\n\nkhu perlative path; means\n\n?d? genitive\n\npossessor\n\nna\n\ngenitive\n\npossessor\n\nthe? comitative co-participant of s/a (companion and reciprocant); instrument; means; material\n\n5.4 The verb complex\nThe verb complex of Jinghpaw is fairly complex, the most expanded form of which may consist of a sequence of verbs followed by a string of various kinds of auxiliaries, which in turn are followed by verbal endings marking verbal categories such as direction, as well as such inflectional categories as number, person, aspect, and mood.\n\n5.4.1 Verbal endings\n\nVerbal endings are manifested as affixes or phonologically independent words, all of which occur after verbs in a fixed linear order. The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form. For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n"

The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages.

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form. For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n998 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\n(a, below), distributivity (b), indefiniteness (c), and plurality of demonstratives (d). Redu­ plication can be employed to form adverbs or adverbial clauses as well (e, f). Related to this is the reduplication-like noun-verb construction which may involve loanwords, such as damyaP mya? ‘rob’ (< Burmese damya ‘robber’) and lawban ban ‘become a boss’ (< Chinese laoban ‘boss’). Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit? [rain-REDUP]\n\n‘whether it rains’\n\n5 SYNTAX\n5.1 Word classes\nThis chapter divides Jinghpaw words into the following five word classes: nouns, verbs, adverbs, particles, and interjections. Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nverbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event; goal of movement; possessor\n\ntha? locative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event; goal of movement; standard of\n\ncomparison\n\n?e\n\nlocative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event\n\nde? allative\n\ngoal of movement; location of existence and event; time of event\n\nhna ablative\n\nsource of movement; location of emergence\n\nkhu perlative path; means\n\n?d? genitive\n\npossessor\n\nna\n\ngenitive\n\npossessor\n\nthe? comitative co-participant of s/a (companion and reciprocant); instrument; means; material\n\n5.4 The verb complex\nThe verb complex of Jinghpaw is fairly complex, the most expanded form of which may consist of a sequence of verbs followed by a string of various kinds of auxiliaries, which in turn are followed by verbal endings marking verbal categories such as direction, as well as such inflectional categories as number, person, aspect, and mood.\n\n5.4.1 Verbal endings\n\nVerbal endings are manifested as affixes or phonologically independent words, all of which occur after verbs in a fixed linear order.

The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

            "question": "Are there serial verb constructions?",
            "summary": "Serial verb constructions are understood as per Haspelmath's definition [(2016: 296)](http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/Files/LL/Docments/Journals/17.3/LLN17.3-Haspelmath.pdf): \"A serial verb construction is a monoclausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element linking them and with no predicate–argument relation between the verbs.\"\n\nSerial verbs are different from [verb compounds](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB122) in that they are compositional. Haspelmath (2016) states that \"a serial verb construction must be a productive schematic construction such that the meaning of a concrete construct can be determined on the basis of the meanings of its parts and the construction meaning.\" By contrast, verbal compounds, which are phonologically bound, are lexicalized and often non-compositional.\n\nGrambank distinguishes serial verb constructions from clause-chaining (see [GB150](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB150)). Clause chaining involves a series of verbs where only one verb is inflected. For a construction to be a serial verb construction, it must align with Haspelmath's definition and not constitute an instance of clause chaining (i.e., there is no single inflected verb while the other verbs are without inflection). Nevertheless, a language may feature both serial verb constructions and clause chaining.\n\nSerial verb constructions are also different from light verb constructions, which are made up of a verbal element and a lexical stem which is not an inflected verb, jointly determining argument structure (see [GB123](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB123)).  \n\nThe term 'verb' here refers to words that can function as independent verbs in the language under consideration. Ideally, these verbs should be dynamic, as per Haspelmath's (2016) definition: \"Verbs are defined as dynamic event expressions that do not have special coding when used in predication function\". Serial verb constructions that are more restricted, such as applying solely to stative verbs (e.g., a verb meaning 'to be good'), should not be counted as 1. Be cautious with descriptions using \"auxiliary verbs\" and \"copulas\" as these typically do not qualify as serial verb constructions.\n\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Code 1 if two or more verbs can be juxtaposed, this verbal sequence functions as a single predicate, there is no predicate-argument relationship between the verbs, and it is not an instance of clause chaining (i.e., no single verb is inflected while the other verbs lack inflection).\n2. Code 0 if no descriptions or examples of serial verb constructions are found in an otherwise comprehensive grammar.\n3.

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 407\n\nmodify ordinary verbs; they modify only certain generalised verbs (GVs) such as [ti33], [ ai31], [ŋa33], [ŋu55] and [ e33].\n\n(1) ʃi33 ŋjan31\n\nai31 wa31 mat31\n\nsai33\n\n3SG dilly-dally GV return completive SFW\n\n‘He took his time going back.’\n\n(2) n31luŋ31 theʔ 31 mjet55\n\nti33 kW31mjet55\n\nstone INST press-press GV press\n\n‘Press it with the stone really hard!’\n\nton31\n\nuʔ 31\n\nleave (in a place) SFW\n\nPostpositions are structural particles such as [eʔ 55], [aʔ 31] and [e31] used following objects, adnominal modifiers, and other constituents to mark relationships among sentence constituents, as in the following examples.\n\n(3) ŋai33 ʃi33 eʔ 55 ja33 sW33ŋai33 1SG 3SG OBJ give SFW ‘I gave it to him.’\n\n(4) ŋai33-nau33\n\naʔ 31 lai31ka33\n\n1SGPOSS-younger.brother GEN book\n\n‘My younger brother’s book.’\n\n(5) ʃW31wa31mW31ʃa31 e31\n\nim31 ton31\n\nthe.masses\n\nAGT capture set down and leave [in a fixed place]\n\n‘To be seized by the masses.’\n\nThe SFW has numerous inflected forms.

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings.

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form. For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n"

These markers are often described as ‘auxiliary verbs’ in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels by some authors (such as STAMP morphemes (STAMP = Subject-Tense-Aspect-Mood-Polarity) or inflecting pronouns). We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking. \n\nThere are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that tense is expressed by a certain form on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing tense then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB121) and the features on bound tense marking ([GB082](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB082)/[GB083](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB083)/[GB084](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB084)).

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

            "question": "Are there verb-adjunct (aka light-verb) constructions?",
            "summary": "\nA light-verb construction is a lexicalized complex predicate with two components: (1) a lexical stem which is not an inflected verb and (2) an inflectable verb, which is called the light verb. It is form-identical with a main verb, but used with a different meaning such that it ‘cannot be said to be predicating fully' (examples in English include _give a sigh_ or _take a plunge_) (Butt 2003).\n\nItems that can occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions are: (1) nouns (e.g. *do baby* in Ivorian English or *have sex* in English for ‘to copulate’), (2) adjectives (e.g. *make beautiful* in English), (3) non-inflectable items such as ideophones (e.g. *do ssss* for ‘to make an ssss sound’), or (4) verbs borrowed from other languages that do not inflect in the target language. \n\nRegular verbs cannot occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions, in the Grambank definition. This makes light verb constructions different from serial verb constructions and verbal compounding, which involve a sequence of more than one verb. Another difference is that there is a predicate-argument relationship between the light verb and the other lexical stem (e.g. in *do baby*, *baby* is the object of *do*), while in serial verb constructions the verbs do not have a predicate-argument relationship between them since they instead describe a sequence of events. \n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Code 1 if verbs with a general meaning may combine with a non-verbal element to produce new verbal predicates. If this is not explicitly mentioned in the grammar's chapter on verbs, check example sentences or word lists. \n2. Code 0 if you do not find examples of new verbal predicates formed by a combination of a verb and a non-verbal element, or if all of these instances can be analyzed as serial verb constructions or verbal compounds.\n\n",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a? Pay.\n\nsun-people pi only first know dance pl-3rd decl\n\n‘The first time, only people of the sun are able to dance the Manau dance.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 405\nfood’, ‘leftovers’; likewise, [luʔ 31] ‘to drink’ follows [khaʔ 31] water in [luʔ 31khaʔ 31] ‘drinking water’. In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nverbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract.

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972).

            "summary": "Noun incorporation is defined as a construction where obligatorily bare (i.e. articleless, numberless, modifierless) nouns must occur adjacent to or inside of the verb, in a fixed order. This feature essentially asks whether transitive verbs may be rendered intransitive by means of noun incorporation, and whether this process is productive. This need not be the default way of intransitivizing verbs, but the process must be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity). The incorporated noun in the construction of interest for this feature is semantically an argument of the verb. For example: *he was painting the bike* = *he was bike-painting*. Noun incorporation where the relevant noun functions as an adjunct or modifier does not count, e.g. *she was running like Jacob runs* = *she was Jacob-running*. A construction where it is necessary to overtly represent the relevant argument with an additional form other than the incorporated noun, for example with a pronoun, also does not count.\n\n",

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a? Pay.\n\nsun-people pi only first know dance pl-3rd decl\n\n‘The first time, only people of the sun are able to dance the Manau dance.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.5 Nominalization and subordination\nThe pervasive use and multifunctionality of clausal nominalization is a prominent feature of Jinghpaw grammar. Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d? Pay. water measure try when fathom 20 deep nmlz know pl-3rd decl ‘They found that the water was 120 feet deep when they measured it.’\n\n(34) [yay Pd-tsom\n\nea no? n-myit yu Pay] [cskhyon Pa? khalem\n\n1sg ADV-beautiful only still NEG-think try nmlz wolf\n\ngen deceive\n\nPay] ga phe? maddt cut\n\nkaw\n\ns-0-e?\n\nPay.\n\nnmlz word acc listen mistake thoroughly csM-3rdp-lstA decl\n\n‘I mistakenly had listened to the wolf’s lying words which I did not think about\n\ncarefully.’\n\n(35) [day ni tha? jdn Pay] ni phe? that pi loc ride nmlz pi acc ‘I saw those who rode them (horses).’\n\nyay mu ijq-ay. lsg see lsg-DECL\n\n\fJTNGHPAW 1009\n\n(36) day ma go [h-tha? la Pay] ea Pwa phay that child TOP NEG-pick take NML2 only father behind ‘The child (went) to his father without picking it up. . >\n\n(37) [ w y nay phai] de? eajjun dat lsg 2sg behind all send release\n‘I sent (him) for you, a n d ..\n\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n998 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\n(a, below), distributivity (b), indefiniteness (c), and plurality of demonstratives (d). Redu­ plication can be employed to form adverbs or adverbial clauses as well (e, f). Related to this is the reduplication-like noun-verb construction which may involve loanwords, such as damyaP mya? ‘rob’ (< Burmese damya ‘robber’) and lawban ban ‘become a boss’ (< Chinese laoban ‘boss’). Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit? [rain-REDUP]\n\n‘whether it rains’\n\n5 SYNTAX\n5.1 Word classes\nThis chapter divides Jinghpaw words into the following five word classes: nouns, verbs, adverbs, particles, and interjections. Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n"

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

            "summary": "\nIn some languages, locative predication (‘X is at Y’) always requires the use of a posture verb (e.g. ‘X sits at Y’ vs. ‘X lies at Y’). The posture verb depends on the shape or the position of the item that is located. For example, a bottle may always ‘stand’ somewhere and a ball may always ‘lie’ somewhere.  In these languages, a speaker could not simply say that something ‘is’ somewhere. Some posture verbs that may occur in languages are verbs for sitting, standing, hanging and lying. Note that this feature does not concern morphological marking of position or shape, but the use of different verbs for this purpose. If the posture verbs are clearly dominant in frequency this is sufficient to count as obligatory for the purpose of this question, even if non-posture verb alternatives are grammatical.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Code 1 if verb roots (not verb morphology) which express location (such as *is* in *the book is on the table*) also encode the posture (‘lie’, ‘stand’, ‘sit’, ‘hang’, e.g. *the book lies on the table* meaning ‘the book is on the table’), and if there is no frequently used more general way of encoding location. This should be clear in a grammar's section on simple clauses, specifically where it discusses predication of location (‘X is at/in Y’).\n2. Code 0 if expressions of location do not usually encode posture. A look at texts and examples should give you an idea of this.\n3.

And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

            "summary": "This feature tracks languages with few members in the word class which is most commonly known as ‘verbs’. If the word class ‘verbs’ contains approximately 100 roots or less, the language qualifies for this feature.  \n\nA large part of the grammar may be devoted to constructions where a verb from the closed class combines with open-class items to form predicates in most sentences. If a grammar never remarks on the size of the verbal inventory this almost always means that the language does not have a small number of verbs in the sense of the present question. If a language has a small number of verbs in this sense, typically a description will say that there is a closed class of verbs with few members. \n\nIn such languages, it is typically the case that what is described by one verb in other languages is instead expressed by so called ‘light verb constructions’ (see [GB123](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB123)). For example, *do meeting* could express the meaning ‘to meet’. It is also possible for a language to have few verbs but no light-verb constructions.\n\n",

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’.

And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages.

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’",

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural.

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33\n\n1sg TOP student\n\nbe SFW (1SG subject, static, declarative)\n\n‘I am a student.’\n\n(7) naŋ33 k ai31 tʃe33 n31tai33 2SG very know SFW (2SG subject, static, declarative) ‘You know how to do a lot.’\n\n(8) khji33 k ai31 kW31pu33 ai33\n\n3SG very glad\n\nSFW (3SG subject, static, declarative)\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n\f408 THE SINO-TIBETAN LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 24.6 A SAMPLE SUBSET OF SFWS IN THE DECLARATIVE MOOD\n\nStatic\n\nDynamic\n\nFirst person Second person Third person\n\nSingular\nŋ 31ŋai33\nn31tai33 ai 33\n\nPlural\nkaʔ 31ai33 mW 31tai 33 maʔ 31ai33\n\nSingular\nsW 33ŋai 33 sin33tai33 sai 33\n\nPlural\nsW55kaʔ 55ai33 mW 33sin33tai 33 mW 33sai 33\n\n(9) ŋai33 mu31 ju33\n\nŋ 31ŋ ai33\n\n1SG see have [done something] SFW (1SG subject, static, declarative)\n\n‘I have seen it.’\n\n(10) sa33 wa31\n\nmW 33sai 33\n\ngo auxiliary verb SFW (3PL subject, static, declarative)\n\n‘They have gone back.’\n\n2.3 Constituent order\n\nAs major mechanisms for expressing grammatical meaning, Jinghpo uses sentence-final word inflection, structural particles and constituent order.

Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33\n"

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person.

All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns). Do not consider ‘left or right-dislocation’, accompanied by intonational signals or pragmatically marked constructions such as focus. If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts. The position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored.\n\n",

All questions concerning order of constituents aim to capture the pragmatically unmarked order between full NP constituents (not pronouns). Do not consider ‘left or right-dislocation', accompanied by intonational signals or pragmatically marked constructions such as focus. If the verb phrase consists of several elements it is the lexical verb that counts. The position of auxiliaries/TAME marking elements can be ignored.\n\n",

This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de?

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

By clausal objects here we mean clauses that are directly governed by a finite verb (often verbs of ‘wanting’, ‘saying’, etc.).

For example, the objects in _I like **apples**_ (nominal object) and _I like **that you play the piano every morning**_ (clausal object) are in the same position (SVO). Many of the languages that do not place clausal objects in the same position as nominal objects are SOV languages that use SVO order for (long) clausal objects. This question aims to discern whether these clausal objects are treated like prototypical nominal direct objects (not indirect or obliques).

A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’\n\n5.2.4 Interrogative pronouns\nMost Jinghpaw interrogatives are analyzable into an element ga- and following mor­ phemes. Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n"

            "summary": "This feature refers to standard negation, or the construction(s) that mark negation of (at least) dynamic (i.e. non-stative) verbal predicates in declarative mood. It is possible that the same negation construction will be used for other purposes as well (e.g. with stative or non-verbal predicates), but clauses involving predicates other than the aforementioned dynamic verbal predicates in declarative mood should be disregarded. \n\nThe position ‘clause-final’ includes [suffixes](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) on verbs in verb-final clauses, even if they are not the very last suffix on the verb. Prefixes on clause-final verbs do not count as clause-final negation. If a negator consists of two obligatory elements and only one is clause-final, this is sufficient to count as clause-final marking and trigger a 1 for this feature. As with other word order features in this dataset, we are concerned with the order of the negative marker when the clause has its canonical intransitive or transitive word order. We are not interested in cases of argument omission or pragmatically marked constructions (e.g. focus); these should be disregarded in coding this feature.\n\n",

If there are multiple markers of standard negation and one occurs clause-finally, code 1 for this feature (GB137) (and if the other marker is clause-initial code 1 for [GB138 Can standard negation be marked clause-initially?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB138)).\n5. If there is no clause-final marker of clausal negation, code 0.\n6. If clause-final markers of clausal negation only occur in pragmatically marked constructions, or with non-verbal or stative predicates, or in non-declarative clauses, code 0.\n7. If a marker of standard negation only occurs clause-finally as a result of argument omission (and occurs in a non-final position when independent nominal or pronominal arguments are included), code 0.\n\n",

If the negator consists of two obligatory elements and only one is clause-initial, this is sufficient to count as clause-initial negation and to trigger a 1 for this feature. As with other word order features in this dataset, we are concerned with the order of the negative marker when the clause has its canonical intransitive or transitive word order.

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d?

My fieldwork was sup­ ported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Nos. 24-2938 and 26-2254) from the Japan Society for the Promotion o f Science (JSPS).\n2 Example sentences are mostly taken from Jinghpaw Readers and the Jinghpaw Bible, which provide a rich exemplification of verbal endings lost in modem spoken Jingh­ paw (see section 5.4.1.6).\n3 Because o f the complex conditions and allomorphy, personal indices are treated as portmanteau with morphemes marking direction, intensity, possessor agreement, and mood in most previous studies, including Hanson (1896), Dai and Xu (1992), and Dai (2012), which employ quite a large number of paradigms or lists to represent them, with the exception of DeLancey (1980, 2011).\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level.

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person.

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted.

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 407\n\nmodify ordinary verbs; they modify only certain generalised verbs (GVs) such as [ti33], [ ai31], [ŋa33], [ŋu55] and [ e33].\n\n(1) ʃi33 ŋjan31\n\nai31 wa31 mat31\n\nsai33\n\n3SG dilly-dally GV return completive SFW\n\n‘He took his time going back.’\n\n(2) n31luŋ31 theʔ 31 mjet55\n\nti33 kW31mjet55\n\nstone INST press-press GV press\n\n‘Press it with the stone really hard!’\n\nton31\n\nuʔ 31\n\nleave (in a place) SFW\n\nPostpositions are structural particles such as [eʔ 55], [aʔ 31] and [e31] used following objects, adnominal modifiers, and other constituents to mark relationships among sentence constituents, as in the following examples.\n\n(3) ŋai33 ʃi33 eʔ 55 ja33 sW33ŋai33 1SG 3SG OBJ give SFW ‘I gave it to him.’\n\n(4) ŋai33-nau33\n\naʔ 31 lai31ka33\n\n1SGPOSS-younger.brother GEN book\n\n‘My younger brother’s book.’\n\n(5) ʃW31wa31mW31ʃa31 e31\n\nim31 ton31\n\nthe.masses\n\nAGT capture set down and leave [in a fixed place]\n\n‘To be seized by the masses.’\n\nThe SFW has numerous inflected forms. Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nJ1NGHPAW 1005\n\nTABLE 53.8 CONDITIONS FOR THE CHOICE BETWEEN SET I AND SET II\n\nConditions\n\nExceptions\n\nSet la Setlb Set II\n\ndeclarative interrogative, speculative, exclamative imperative, hortative, or the direction slot is filled with pa/intns\n\n2nd person plural (marked by Set II) 2nd person plural (marked by Set II) 1st person in hortative (marked by Set la)\n\nTABLE 53.9 PARADIGMS OF SA ‘GO/COME’AND RAY ‘COP’\n\nDeclarative\n\nDeclarative with r- ‘ v e n ’ Interrogative Declarative with 1- ‘ p a ’\n\nlsg sa yrj-ay\n\nsa r-'u) y-ay\n\n2 s g sa hd-ay\n\nsa r-in d-ay\n\n3 s g sa 0-?ay\n\nsa r-a?

Example: La wa md sit (you, plural), take it away.\nThe above examples show the strictly grammatical application of the\naffixes. Mu is very commonly used without consideration as to whether one or\nmore persons are addressed, particularly when it euphonizes with the verb better than u does.\n66. The prohibitive form is made by placing khum or shum (don’t) before the verb with or without the Imperative signs.\nExample.\n\nKhum sa or khum sa z/=Don’t go ; nanhte khum kdsat mu= Don’t\nyou fight. Forms of Interrogation.\n\n67. The particles denoting interrogation are i, ta, kun. They are gen­\n\nerally preceded by a verbal affix, and frequently by rai (to be) with or\n\nwithout the verbal affix.\n\ni is used in a general way in asking questions.\n\nta is used when explicit information is required.\n\nni simply puts a question for confirmation.\n\nkun puts the questions conjecturally.\n\nyaw, soliciting acquiescence, is generally used after an imperative\n\nsign. ,\n\nExamples.\n\nLashi ni hte khrum sa i ? = Did you meet the Lashis ? Nang hpa di na i ? = What will you do ? Shi hpa ra ai ta ? = What does he want ? Shanhte kananghprawngma rai ta ? = Where have they fled to? Nang kumhpraw lu se ni ? — Did you receive money ? Sht ngai hpe kayat na n ngu se ni ? = Did he not say that he would\nbeat me? Hpa kun ? = What can it be ? Kadai sa na kun? = (I wonder) who will go ? Ndaigaw nang kalaw mu, yaw ? = You do this, won’t you\n\nForm of Negation.\n\n68. Negatived words are very commonly used in Kachin and frequent­ ly supply the want of word, as n kaja, not good, instead of bad, for which\nthere is no word. Negation is expressed by placing n (sounded as a sonant) before the\nverb or by the prohibitive khum or shum.\n\nExamples.\n\nShi madi ai majaw wan n khru ai, = It will not burn because it is wet.\n\nPungli n kalaw yang gaw nang kumhpraw n lu na rai= If you do not work you will not get money.\n\nKhum shdga u = Don’t speak {see section 66).\n"

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n"

Often, such a distinction surfaces in predicates referring to sensations (such as hunger, thirst, pain, cold, cramps, sleepiness, etc.), emotions (anger, happiness), or cognitive states (forgetting, remembering). These uncontrolled predicates may be found in specialized constructions, including different case frames (‘sleep hits me’), special conjugation classes of verbs or adjectives, dedicated (modal) markers for control vs. non-control, etc. Other terms that may be used in the literature are non-volitional, non-agentive, non-volitive or involuntary. Note that we are not interested in how stative events with *inanimate* experiencers are coded: their coding is irrelevant, whether they show distinctions with controlled events or states or not. The existence of verbal derivations such as passive or causative does not count here. At least three different predicates should show a special kind of construction to code 1 for this feature.\n\n",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

                "content": "2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

            "summary": "\nPassivization is a detransitivizing operation that takes a transitive clause (*The dog bites the man.*) and turns it into an intransitive clause by promoting the [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the man*) to morphosyntactic [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) function. In the resulting intransitive clause, the former [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument (*the dog*) either vanishes or adopts an oblique function: *The man is bitten (by the dog).* ‘Mediopassives’, ‘anticausatives’ and the sort (e.g. ‘x breaks the vase’ > ‘the vase breaks’) also count as passives. This question targets [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) passive markers on lexical verbs. Anything that happens with auxiliaries is irrelevant here.\n\nSometimes a language uses a combination of an auxiliary and a special form of the verb to express passive clauses. This verb form may be called a 'participle' or 'infinitive'. If such participial or infinitival forms are morphologically marked (that is, they are not unmarked/zero-marked), they also trigger a 1 for this feature.\n\n",

Add a comment that your analysis is based on orthography here.\n3. Code 1 if you identify a phonologically bound passive marker in the examples/texts provided in a source. Investigate sections on verb morphology, valency change and argument structure.\n4. Code 0 if a source mentions that there is no passive.  \n5.

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover\n"

In a construction with ergative alignment, this means that the [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument of a transitive clause is encoded as the [S](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) argument in a corresponding antipassive clause. An antipassive marker often also has other detransitivizing functions, such as reflexivization, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative.  In practice, this feature targets any intransitivising marker that is not, or not only, a reflexive, reciprocal, passive, or anticausative marker. This question targets productive [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) antipassive markers on lexical verbs, as well as reduplication. Zero-marking or the removal of a transitivizing marker is not sufficient for a 1. Anything that happens with auxiliaries is irrelevant here. If the antipassive marker is only applied in a limited set of probably lexicalized items, it does not trigger 1.\n\n",

The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person.

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 405\nfood’, ‘leftovers’; likewise, [luʔ 31] ‘to drink’ follows [khaʔ 31] water in [luʔ 31khaʔ 31] ‘drinking water’.

The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’.

The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 407\n\nmodify ordinary verbs; they modify only certain generalised verbs (GVs) such as [ti33], [ ai31], [ŋa33], [ŋu55] and [ e33].\n\n(1) ʃi33 ŋjan31\n\nai31 wa31 mat31\n\nsai33\n\n3SG dilly-dally GV return completive SFW\n\n‘He took his time going back.’\n\n(2) n31luŋ31 theʔ 31 mjet55\n\nti33 kW31mjet55\n\nstone INST press-press GV press\n\n‘Press it with the stone really hard!’\n\nton31\n\nuʔ 31\n\nleave (in a place) SFW\n\nPostpositions are structural particles such as [eʔ 55], [aʔ 31] and [e31] used following objects, adnominal modifiers, and other constituents to mark relationships among sentence constituents, as in the following examples.\n\n(3) ŋai33 ʃi33 eʔ 55 ja33 sW33ŋai33 1SG 3SG OBJ give SFW ‘I gave it to him.’\n\n(4) ŋai33-nau33\n\naʔ 31 lai31ka33\n\n1SGPOSS-younger.brother GEN book\n\n‘My younger brother’s book.’\n\n(5) ʃW31wa31mW31ʃa31 e31\n\nim31 ton31\n\nthe.masses\n\nAGT capture set down and leave [in a fixed place]\n\n‘To be seized by the masses.’\n\nThe SFW has numerous inflected forms. Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n(13) a. sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nb. sa\n\ns-it-0.\n\ngo/come VEN-2nd-iMP go/come AND-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here!’\n\n‘Go away!’\n\nOther morphemes that occupy the same slot include /- ‘pa’ and n- ‘intns.’The morpheme /- ‘pa’ is used to signal agreement with a possessor of an argument, as in (10). Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-\n"

            "summary": "Clause-chaining involves sequences of medial clauses (i.e. formally reduced or restricted clauses that do not have the full marking that usually occurs on the verb) which are dependent on a single, fully inflected verb that often (but not always) occurs in final clause. Clause chains may also be referred to as topic chains or as sequences of medial clauses/medial verbs. Crucially, this construction involves a single clause with a full, unrestricted, finite verb form and medial clauses that are dependent on it for specification of inflectional categories (e.g. TAM). \n\nClause chains are often used to describe sequences of events, and the medial verbs involved may be marked by [special affixes to indicate temporal relationships](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB152). Clause chains may also include markers of [switch reference](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB151). Medial verbs in some languages may be marked in the usual way for person/number of their arguments, though they generally lack some other canonical verbal inflection or involve specific marked verb forms that cannot be used in freestanding clauses. \n\nThere is considerable debate regarding the syntax of clause chaining generally and within individual languages. This construction is not merely a series of juxtaposed minimal clauses, as it requires dependency on one fully specified clause for full interpretation. It is also not straightforwardly a series of subordinated clauses (as in the series of temporal adjuncts in English, *Before he ate, while he was cooking the soup, he added salt.*). The syntactic relationship between clauses in clause chains is often described as a special type of coordination or a form of cosubordination.\n\nIn some cases clause-chaining may be difficult to distinguish from [serial verb constructions](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB118). Remember that a serial verb construction involves a set of verbs or verb phrases that function as a single predicate, whereas clause-chaining involves a set of *clauses* with formally reduced verbs, all dependent on a single fully specified verb form. Clause-chaining is also different from [verb compounding](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB122) in that the clauses in clause chaining are [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) and express separate propositions, which is not the case for verb compounding. In cases where it is unclear which of these constructions is represented by the examples in the grammar, a ? may be coded, but be sure to indicate in the comments that you were unable to determine which of these constructions is demonstrated in the relevant examples.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Code 1 if the language can express a sequence of events through a series of clauses with morphologically reduced verb forms that are dependent on a single, fully-specified verb form (which typically occurs in the final clause).\n2. Code 0 if the language can express a sequence of events through a set of verbs or verb phrases, but these verbs are each fully inflected (i.e. there are not reduced verb forms that depend on a single fully-inflected form for specification of required grammatical categories).\n3. Code 0 and consider [GB118](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB118) if the language has constructions involving a sequence of verbs, but the sequence of verb forms always functions as a single predicate rather than a series of clauses.\n4. Code 0 and see [GB122](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB122) if the language has a construction that involves multiple verbs in sequence, but these verbs appear to function as a phonological and grammatical word, and/or describe a single event rather than separate propositions.\n5. If you are uncertain whether a construction involving a series of clauses is clause chaining or instead a sequence of subordinated clauses, either open an issue to discuss the data or code ? and provide a comment.\n6. If you are uncertain whether there is a construction that meets the criteria above for clause-chaining or whether all examples involving series of verbs exemplify another construction (e.g. serial verbs or verb compounding), code ? and provide a comment.\n\n",

As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Some languages (e.g. Kashaya) signal switch reference by using different allomorphs of TAM markers depending on whether the subject of the following clause is the same or different. Some systems (e.g. Southeastern Pomo) only have special morphology to indicate different subjects, whereas the contrasting morphological pattern that is used for coreferential subjects can also be used for some combinations of clauses with different referents.\n\nIn some languages the prominent argument that serves as the pivot of switch reference is the topic, rather than strictly the grammatical subject of the clause.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Examine sections of the grammar that describe clause combining and multi-clausal constructions, or examine examples of multi-clausal constructions if the grammar does not explicitly designate sections to describe multi-clausal constructions.\n2. Code 1 if there is a marker or morphological alternation in the verbal domain that signals whether the subject of a clause has the same or a different referent as/than an argument (usually the subject) of an adjacent clause.\n3. Code 1 if there is a marker that signals (non-)coreference between an argument of a clause and an argument of an adjacent clause, with the opposite unmarked (e.g. non-coreference marked overtly and coreference unmarked).\n4. Code 0 if there are no morphological alternations associated with coreference of arguments in adjacent clauses.\n\n",
            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nThe Jinghpaw person indexation system is based on both grammatical roles and a person hierarchy in which SAPs outrank a 3rd person (SAP > 3rd). Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit?

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n"

In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

This question targets causative constructions with an element that clearly originated as a verb for ‘to say’ (e.g. *I said for the stone to fall* to mean ‘I made the stone fall’).

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\n406 THE SINO-TIBETAN LANGUAGES\nThe great majority of the former are distinguished with a phonologically conditioned prefix that takes three forms: [tʃW31-], [ʃW31-] and [sW31-]. This prefix distinguishes [tʃW31phai33] ‘to make (somebody) lift (something) up’ from [phai33] ‘to lift (something) up’, ‘tʃW31kh at31’ ‘to drop (something) from (kh at31) ‘(for something) to drop’, [ʃW31pa55] ‘to tire (somebody)’ from [pa55] ‘to be tired’, [ʃW31tʃe33] ‘to let (somebody) know’ from [tʃe33] ‘to know’ and [sW31tsam33] ‘to make (something) rot’, ‘decay’ from [tsam33] ‘to rot, decay’ and so on.\nA number of verbs are causativized with the prefix [a31-]: [k op31] ‘(for something) to shatter’ and [a31k op31] ‘to shatter (something)’. A few verbs distinguish the causative by suppletive alternation: [ oŋ33] ‘(for something) to be inside (something else)’ and [ oŋ55] ‘to place (something) inside (something else)’; [tʃuŋ31] ‘(for something) to be loaded with (something else)’ and [tʃun55] ‘to load (something) with (something else)’.\nThe syntactic causative construction simply places the verb [ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause’ after the non-causative verb: [sa33] ‘to go’ and [sa33 ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause to go’; [kW31lo33] ‘to do’ and [kW31lo33 ʃ W31ŋun55] ‘to cause to do’.\nVerbs can be reduplicated with the added meaning of ‘constantly, regularly’ or ‘slightly’. Compare [sa33] ‘to go’ and [sa33sa33] ‘to go on a regular basis’, or [tʃe33] ‘to know’ and [tʃe33tʃe33] ‘to know to a limited extent’.\nAuxiliary verbs are relatively numerous; they follow verbs to express the direction, progress, or nature of the action. For example, [khat55] expresses that the action is reciprocal: [kW31 um33] means ‘to help’ and [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’. The auxiliary [kh at31] specifies that the action involves downward motion: [jon33] means ‘to trickle, drip’ and [jon33 kh at31] ‘to trickle down’, ‘to drip down’.

Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.4.2 Verb serialization\n\nJinghpaw verbs can be serialized productively, without any overt marker o f coordination or subordination, constituting a single predicate. Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a? Pay.\n\nsun-people pi only first know dance pl-3rd decl\n\n‘The first time, only people of the sun are able to dance the Manau dance.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nverbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Redu­ plication can be employed to form adverbs or adverbial clauses as well (e, f). Related to this is the reduplication-like noun-verb construction which may involve loanwords, such as damyaP mya? ‘rob’ (< Burmese damya ‘robber’) and lawban ban ‘become a boss’ (< Chinese laoban ‘boss’). Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit? [rain-REDUP]\n\n‘whether it rains’\n\n5 SYNTAX\n5.1 Word classes\nThis chapter divides Jinghpaw words into the following five word classes: nouns, verbs, adverbs, particles, and interjections. Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nverbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.4.2 Verb serialization\n\nJinghpaw verbs can be serialized productively, without any overt marker o f coordination or subordination, constituting a single predicate. Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form. For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2 The noun phrase\n\nWithin an np, genitive and relative modifiers occur in the pre-head position, while modi­ fiers such as an adjective, plural marker ni, numeral and classifier occur in the post-head position, as in (4). A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n"

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

            "summary": "This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of paucal number on nouns (From Latin _paucalis_ ‘few, little’). Paucal is a number value that refers to a non-specified small amount usually between two or more and ten or less. The exact value can depend on what is being counted. The marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB320 Is paucal number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB320) which focuses on the non-bound marking of paucal number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1.\n\nNumber marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking. If the grammar writers describe the marker as denoting grammatical number and there are several examples, this suffices.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with number or nominal morphology.\n2. If the author describes a bound marker of paucal number on the noun that occurs regularly, code 1.\n3. If the only marking of paucal number occurs on nouns derived from other word classes (adjectives, verbs etc.) or on a small subset of nouns, code 0.\n4. If the grammar mentions that paucal number is not marked productively, or that it is marked somewhere else than on the noun, code as 0.\n5. If the grammar does not describe number marking at all and you have a reason to believe that the author may have missed it, code ?.\n6. If the grammar does not describe number, you encounter no examples of number marking, and the grammar is otherwise comprehensive, code 0.\n\n",

A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position.

Redu­ plication can be employed to form adverbs or adverbial clauses as well (e, f). Related to this is the reduplication-like noun-verb construction which may involve loanwords, such as damyaP mya? ‘rob’ (< Burmese damya ‘robber’) and lawban ban ‘become a boss’ (< Chinese laoban ‘boss’). Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit?

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n"

For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n\nIn contrast to common nouns, which take a full range of adnominals, closed classes of nouns cannot take the same range of adnominals. Demonstratives and personal pronouns, for example, only allow post-adnominals. Table 53.4 summarizes the properties of noun sub­ classes in terms of whether a given noun: (a) can be the head of an np; (b) can occur on its own; (c) can be pluralized by the plural marker; (d) can be quantified by a numeral; (e) can be determinated by a pre-head demonstrative; (f) can be preceded by a relative clause; (g) can be preceded by a genitive phrase; (h) can be determinated by a post-head demonstra­ tive; (i) can be modified by an adjective; or (j) can be involved in partial reduplication.\n\n5.2.1 Demonstratives\nJinghpaw demonstratives are distinguished in terms of speaker/addressee orientation, rel­ ative distance, and height from the speaker: nday [proximal; speaker-centered]; day [proximal; addressee-centered]; wd-ra [distal; level]; tho-ra [distal; up]; le-ra [distal; down], the latter three of which involve eara ‘place.’Demonstratives may occur in pre- or post-head positions, except when they modify locator nouns or postpositions, in which case only pre-head position is grammatical. Only proximal demonstratives may be used for anaphora or cataphora.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.2 Personalpronouns\nThe personal pronoun system exhibits three-way splits in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural), yielding the paradigm given in Table 53.5.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.4.2 Verb serialization\n\nJinghpaw verbs can be serialized productively, without any overt marker o f coordination or subordination, constituting a single predicate. Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a? Pay.\n\nsun-people pi only first know dance pl-3rd decl\n\n‘The first time, only people of the sun are able to dance the Manau dance.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2 The noun phrase\n\nWithin an np, genitive and relative modifiers occur in the pre-head position, while modi­ fiers such as an adjective, plural marker ni, numeral and classifier occur in the post-head position, as in (4). A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n"

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used.

And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages.

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73).

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun.

Demonstratives and personal pronouns, for example, only allow post-adnominals. Table 53.4 summarizes the properties of noun sub­ classes in terms of whether a given noun: (a) can be the head of an np; (b) can occur on its own; (c) can be pluralized by the plural marker; (d) can be quantified by a numeral; (e) can be determinated by a pre-head demonstrative; (f) can be preceded by a relative clause; (g) can be preceded by a genitive phrase; (h) can be determinated by a post-head demonstra­ tive; (i) can be modified by an adjective; or (j) can be involved in partial reduplication.\n\n5.2.1 Demonstratives\nJinghpaw demonstratives are distinguished in terms of speaker/addressee orientation, rel­ ative distance, and height from the speaker: nday [proximal; speaker-centered]; day [proximal; addressee-centered]; wd-ra [distal; level]; tho-ra [distal; up]; le-ra [distal; down], the latter three of which involve eara ‘place.’Demonstratives may occur in pre- or post-head positions, except when they modify locator nouns or postpositions, in which case only pre-head position is grammatical. Only proximal demonstratives may be used for anaphora or cataphora.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.2 Personalpronouns\nThe personal pronoun system exhibits three-way splits in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural), yielding the paradigm given in Table 53.5. There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73).

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking. Note that the 2nd person prefix h- apparently came from nay ‘you’ or\n\nTABLE 53.4 PROPERTIES OF NOUN SUBCLASSES\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) 00 (f) (g) (h) (0 (i)\n\ncommon nouns\n\nyes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes some\n\nnumerals\n\nyes yes yes no yes yes yes yes no yes\n\ndemonstratives\n\nyes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\npersonal pronouns\n\nyes yes some yes no no no no no no\n\ninterrogative pronouns yes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\nlocator nouns\n\nyes yes no\n\nno yes yes yes no no no\n\npostpositions\n\nyes no no\n\nno yes yes yes no no some\n\n\f1000 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS\n\nSingular ( n o m )\n\nSingular ( g e n )\n\n1st\n\nnay\n\n2nd\n\nnag\n\n3rd\n\nei\n\nnye? na? ei?\n\nDual\nPan nan ean\n\nPlural\n?anlhe nanthe eanthe\n\nna? ‘your.’ Less apparent, the 3rd person prefix ga- seems to have a historical connection to the 3rd person pronoun which is pronounced khyi in some Jinghpaw varieties (Dai and Xu 1992: 23), suggesting a sound change *khyi > ei in Standard Jinghpaw.\n\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n998 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\n(a, below), distributivity (b), indefiniteness (c), and plurality of demonstratives (d). Redu­ plication can be employed to form adverbs or adverbial clauses as well (e, f). Related to this is the reduplication-like noun-verb construction which may involve loanwords, such as damyaP mya? ‘rob’ (< Burmese damya ‘robber’) and lawban ban ‘become a boss’ (< Chinese laoban ‘boss’). Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit?

Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

Examples of phonological properties that may play a role in gender/class assignment include tone, initial consonants, or root-final segments.

Pronoun systems that encode other grammatical gender/noun class categories in second person forms in the absence of a masculine/feminine distinction are not sufficient to satisfy this criterion. Languages that qualify for a 1 code for this feature will include a distinction between masculine and feminine forms in at least some categories of second person independent pronouns, but possibly not all categories. In many languages this contrast occurs only in the singular pronouns; that is, there is a contrast between masculine and feminine forms for second person singular, but not for second person plural (or dual, or any other non-singular number category). In some languages there is a contrast in multiple number categories, including singular and some non-singular number categories. It is uncommon for a language to have a masculine/feminine contrast in non-singular second person pronouns but not in the singular pronouns.

The masculine or feminine gender of individuals of the human fami­ ly is distinguished by different words, such as—\nSabrang = A lad, a young unmarried man, Makhavon = A maid, a young unmarried woman, Tingla = An old man, Kumgai ■ An old woman, Sinkra — A widower, Kaita or Kaina = A widow, and by most of the terms of relationship.\n17. The gender is also distinguished by placing la or lasha. for the male and num or numsha for the female before words of common gender.\nShadang and shayi for male and female are used likewise. Kdsha = A child. La kdsha = K male child. Num kdsha = A female child. Shadang sha = K son. Shayi sha = K daughter.\n17 (a). A lusty young man is sometimes called a gwila. There is no feminine term corresponding to gwila.\n18. But in the case of proper nouns of common gender the words la and num denoting the gender follow the noun as a rule.\nExamples.\nMyen la = A. Burman. Myen num=h Burmese woman.\n10. Wa for the masculine andjan for the feminine which are as often used as la and num always follow nouns of common gender.\nExamples.\nKdnau = Meaning a younger brother or sister. Kanau w« = Younger brother. Kanau jan = Younger sister. Muwa wa = Chinaman. Muvoa jan = Chinese woman.\n\n\f( 7 )\n\n20. The gender of the inferior animals is distinguished by affixing to the noun la for males and yi for females.",

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun.

This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9.

As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

            "question": "What is the order of the adnominal collective universal quantifier (‘all’) and the noun?",
            "summary": "GB203 is concerned with the ordering of a universal quantifier (‘all’) and the noun. This feature has also been split into two binary features, \"GB203a Is the order of the adnominal collective universal quantifier (UQ) and noun UQ-N?\" and \"GB203b Is the order of the adnominal collective universal quantifier (UQ) and noun N-QU?\". It is possible to answer 1 or 0 for one of the binarised features, and \"?\" for the other. It is possible that there is no adnominal collective universal quantifier, in which case GB203, GB203a and GB203b are all 0 (see procedure).\n\nAs with other word order features in this database, this is focused specifically on adnominal quantification in pragmatically unmarked contexts. In languages that do not have a distinction between collective and distributive universal quantifiers (‘all’ vs. ‘every’), a quantifier that could be translated as ‘all’ and has a primarily plural use will be a sufficient target for this feature.\n\nThere are four possible codes for this feature, reflecting the fact that the collective universal quantifier might occur strictly before or strictly after the noun, may be allowed in both of these relative positions, or may not be present in a language. A 0 code is also applicable when the language does not allow a basic construction with an adnominal collective universal quantifier and a noun (e.g. if only a floating construction is used).\n\nOrders that result from constructions like quantifier float (e.g. English *The children have **all** come.*) should be disregarded for the purposes of coding this feature. \n\n",
            "procedure": "1. If there is a collective universal quantifier, or a general universal quantifier that can be translated as ‘all’, and that quantifier occurs only before the noun (UQ-N), code 1 for GB203 or 1 for GB203a.\n2. If there is a collective universal quantifier, or a general universal quantifier that can be translated as ‘all’, and that quantifier occurs only after the noun (N-UQ), code 2for GB203 or 1 for GB203b.\n3. If the collective universal quantifier or equivalent can occur either before or after the noun (UQ-N *or* N-UQ) in non-quantifier float constructions, code 3 for GB203 or 1 for GB203a and GB203b.\n4. If there is no collective universal quantifier or other universal quantifier that can be translated as ‘all’ and be used in an adnominal construction, code 0 for GB203 or GB203a and GB203b.\n5. If there is no mention of universal quantifiers at all, code ? and note that there is insufficient information to make a determination.\n\n",
            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form. For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n998 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\n(a, below), distributivity (b), indefiniteness (c), and plurality of demonstratives (d). Redu­ plication can be employed to form adverbs or adverbial clauses as well (e, f). Related to this is the reduplication-like noun-verb construction which may involve loanwords, such as damyaP mya? ‘rob’ (< Burmese damya ‘robber’) and lawban ban ‘become a boss’ (< Chinese laoban ‘boss’). Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit?

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’\n\n5.2.4 Interrogative pronouns\nMost Jinghpaw interrogatives are analyzable into an element ga- and following mor­ phemes. Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.\n"

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd?

For this feature, we are looking for a verb that expresses predicative possession where the possessor is the subject, the possessum the object and the verb is finite and clearly transitive. The finite element in itself need not be clearly distinct from an existential or locational predicator, the main difference is the argument structure. \n\nTransitivity is a language-specific category that needs to be investigated separately to learn whether or not the construction is transitive. In case of languages where transitivity is hard to define it might be beneficial to compare to verbs of holding and grasping. It is very likely that habeo-verb constructions arise from possessive constructions where the possessor is expressed as a topic.\n\n",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event; goal of movement; possessor\n\ntha? locative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event; goal of movement; standard of\n\ncomparison\n\n?e\n\nlocative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event\n\nde? allative\n\ngoal of movement; location of existence and event; time of event\n\nhna ablative\n\nsource of movement; location of emergence\n\nkhu perlative path; means\n\n?d? genitive\n\npossessor\n\nna\n\ngenitive\n\npossessor\n\nthe? comitative co-participant of s/a (companion and reciprocant); instrument; means; material\n\n5.4 The verb complex\nThe verb complex of Jinghpaw is fairly complex, the most expanded form of which may consist of a sequence of verbs followed by a string of various kinds of auxiliaries, which in turn are followed by verbal endings marking verbal categories such as direction, as well as such inflectional categories as number, person, aspect, and mood.\n\n5.4.1 Verbal endings\n\nVerbal endings are manifested as affixes or phonologically independent words, all of which occur after verbs in a fixed linear order. The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.2 Personalpronouns\nThe personal pronoun system exhibits three-way splits in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural), yielding the paradigm given in Table 53.5.

When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

This feature concerns a clause which features a comitative/conjunctional construction (c.f. Stassen 2000, 2001, 2013). The predicate is an existential/locational/copula and the possessum or possessor is marked by an element marking simultaneity between clauses, or ‘also/too’, or subordinating conjunction (‘when/while’), or coordinating particle (‘and’), or a comitative marker (‘with’). The marker need not be [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence). Both constructions where the possessor and constructions where the possessum is marked by the comitative marker count.\n\n",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T",

Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Tone 1 is marked as a high level tone, e.g. [mu55] ‘work’, [kW55wa55] ‘bamboo’, but only in laryngealized syllables is it actually pronounced as a high level tone ([pai55] left (as opposed to right)); in non-laryngealized syllables it is pronounced as a mid-to-high rising tone ([pai35] again). Tone 2 is a mid level tone: [mu33] ‘delicious’, [wa33] ‘tooth’. Tone 3 is a low falling tone: [mu31] ‘to see’, [wa31] ‘to return’. Tone 4 falls from a high pitch across the full pitch range to a low pitch: [nu51] ‘mother’ (term of direct address), [wa51] ‘father’ (term of direct address). All four tones occur in unchecked syllables, while checked syllables are either the high level tone or the low falling tone. The great preponderance of high-to-low falling tones occur as a result of sandhi. For example, the expression combining [n55] ‘not with’ [wa31] ‘to return’ is [n55 wa51] ‘not to return’.\n1.4 Syllable structure\nSeven types of syllable structures occur. Type 1 is V + T (vowel with tone): [aʔ31] [X]’s. Type 2 is V + V + T: [ai31] ‘very’. Type 3 is V + C + T (vowel plus consonant with tone): [aŋ31] appropriate. Type 4 is C + V + T: [na33] ‘ear’. Type 5 is C + V + V + T: [nai31] ‘taro’. Type 6 is C + V + C + T: [naŋ33] you (singular). Type 7, which involves syllabic nasals, is C + T: [n55] ‘not’.\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural.

My fieldwork was sup­ ported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Nos. 24-2938 and 26-2254) from the Japan Society for the Promotion o f Science (JSPS).\n2 Example sentences are mostly taken from Jinghpaw Readers and the Jinghpaw Bible, which provide a rich exemplification of verbal endings lost in modem spoken Jingh­ paw (see section 5.4.1.6).\n3 Because o f the complex conditions and allomorphy, personal indices are treated as portmanteau with morphemes marking direction, intensity, possessor agreement, and mood in most previous studies, including Hanson (1896), Dai and Xu (1992), and Dai (2012), which employ quite a large number of paradigms or lists to represent them, with the exception of DeLancey (1980, 2011).\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 407\n\nmodify ordinary verbs; they modify only certain generalised verbs (GVs) such as [ti33], [ ai31], [ŋa33], [ŋu55] and [ e33].\n\n(1) ʃi33 ŋjan31\n\nai31 wa31 mat31\n\nsai33\n\n3SG dilly-dally GV return completive SFW\n\n‘He took his time going back.’\n\n(2) n31luŋ31 theʔ 31 mjet55\n\nti33 kW31mjet55\n\nstone INST press-press GV press\n\n‘Press it with the stone really hard!’\n\nton31\n\nuʔ 31\n\nleave (in a place) SFW\n\nPostpositions are structural particles such as [eʔ 55], [aʔ 31] and [e31] used following objects, adnominal modifiers, and other constituents to mark relationships among sentence constituents, as in the following examples.\n\n(3) ŋai33 ʃi33 eʔ 55 ja33 sW33ŋai33 1SG 3SG OBJ give SFW ‘I gave it to him.’\n\n(4) ŋai33-nau33\n\naʔ 31 lai31ka33\n\n1SGPOSS-younger.brother GEN book\n\n‘My younger brother’s book.’\n\n(5) ʃW31wa31mW31ʃa31 e31\n\nim31 ton31\n\nthe.masses\n\nAGT capture set down and leave [in a fixed place]\n\n‘To be seized by the masses.’\n\nThe SFW has numerous inflected forms. Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33\n"

This particle does not have to be obligatory, and it is sufficient if the particle does not always appear in clause-final position.\n\nDryer (2013) distinguishes **neutral** questions from **leading** questions in the paragraph quoted below. This feature in Grambank concerns neutral questions.\n\n\"Many languages have question particles or expressions that indicate that the question is a leading question, one where the speaker has an expectation as to what the answer will be. English, for example, employs what are called \"tag-questions\" for this purpose, illustrated in (13a), which differ from the neutral question form illustrated in (13b) in that its form indicates that the speaker expects a ‘yes’ answer.\n\n13a.

                "content": "5.2.2 Personalpronouns\nThe personal pronoun system exhibits three-way splits in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural), yielding the paradigm given in Table 53.5. There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73).

[ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1006 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nspeaker puts one participant in focus, while the latter is used when the speaker focuses on two participants (Scott DeLancey, personal communication).

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

Specifically, this construction must involve two conjoined clauses, one containing the standard of comparison and one containing the object of comparison, with no additional, obligatory, special markers of comparison (e.g. English *than*, or *surpass/exceed*). The NPs expressing the standard and object of comparison typically have the same function in the clauses. Note that many languages can juxtapose clauses (e.g. English *She is nice and he is not nice.*), however these sorts of constructions should only be considered for this feature when they are a dedicated way of expressing comparative meaning (e.g. when the structure clearly has a meaning like, ‘She is nicer than he is.’). In other words, we are focused on languages that have a dedicated comparative construction involving conjoined clauses.\n\n",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nverbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion.

Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion.

We specifically focus on comparative constructions where the standard of comparison is overtly expressed (e.g. meanings like ‘Maria is taller than John’) but also count clearly comparative forms where the standard of comparison is null/implied/inferred from the context (e.g. meanings like ‘Maria is taller’). The comparative constructions of interest express superiority (as in the French and English examples above), not inferiority (e.g. meanings like ‘John is less athletic than Maria’).\n\nThis feature requires that the degree marker modify the property word. It should not be phonologically bound.\n\n",

A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level.

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person.

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1006 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nspeaker puts one participant in focus, while the latter is used when the speaker focuses on two participants (Scott DeLancey, personal communication).

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template.

Tone 4 falls from a high pitch across the full pitch range to a low pitch: [nu51] ‘mother’ (term of direct address), [wa51] ‘father’ (term of direct address). All four tones occur in unchecked syllables, while checked syllables are either the high level tone or the low falling tone. The great preponderance of high-to-low falling tones occur as a result of sandhi. For example, the expression combining [n55] ‘not with’ [wa31] ‘to return’ is [n55 wa51] ‘not to return’.\n1.4 Syllable structure\nSeven types of syllable structures occur. Type 1 is V + T (vowel with tone): [aʔ31] [X]’s. Type 2 is V + V + T: [ai31] ‘very’. Type 3 is V + C + T (vowel plus consonant with tone): [aŋ31] appropriate. Type 4 is C + V + T: [na33] ‘ear’. Type 5 is C + V + V + T: [nai31] ‘taro’. Type 6 is C + V + C + T: [naŋ33] you (singular). Type 7, which involves syllabic nasals, is C + T: [n55] ‘not’.\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation",

In the context of this feature, 'tone' refers to pitch variations tied to specific positions within a word or a clause, and not to global intonation patterns affecting the whole clause.

Otherwise it is [ə] or [ß]. In the high level tone some laryngealized vowels alternate with nonlaryngealized variants. For example, [ka55] alternates with [ka55] as earth, place. Lexical contrasts among these rhymes are illustrated in Table 24.4.\n1.3 Tones\nThere are four tones altogether. Tone 1 is marked as a high level tone, e.g. [mu55] ‘work’, [kW55wa55] ‘bamboo’, but only in laryngealized syllables is it actually pronounced as a high level tone ([pai55] left (as opposed to right)); in non-laryngealized syllables it is pronounced as a mid-to-high rising tone ([pai35] again).

Monosyllables are always heavy, being headed either by phonetically long vowels or phonetically short vowels followed by coda consonants. A large number of disyllables take the form of the iambic or ‘sesquisyllabic’ structure (Matisoff 1973), consisting of a major (heavy) syllable preceded by a minor (light) syllable with reduced phonemic possibilities. The examples given in Table 53.3 illustrate the Jinghpaw word structures.\nThe major syllable allows up to two prenuclear consonants and one postnuclear con­ sonant, so that the maximal structure is C]C2vc3, plus a tone, c, may be any consonant in the inventory when c2 is not filled. Sonority must increase in the onset. Two sonorants /r/ and lyl may occur as c2 when the preceding consonant is a stop (bilabial, velar) or nasal (bilabial, alveolar), except for the combination of a nasal plus /r/. The optional coda con­ sonant (c3) can be /p, t, k, ?, m, n, q, w, y/, where /k/ is mostly restricted to loanwords, as the Proto-Tibeto-Burman (PTB) coda *k has developed into 111 in modem Jinghpaw (Benedict 1972: 14). The four diphthongs, ui, oi, ai, au, can be interpreted phonologically as a sequence o f a vowel plus a glide, i.e. /uy/, /oy/, /ay/, /aw/, based on the fact that they never occur in closed syllables. The vowel-coda combination (vc3) is basically free, except when v is a schwa or when c3 is a glide.",

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJinghpo has been analysed as having thirty-one syllable onsets; they are displayed in Table 24.1. Three onsets [tsh, tʃh, f] occur only in loanwords. Retroflex onsets [p , ph , k , kh ] have\nthe tongue tip curled back slightly, with slight friction during release of the plosives. Nasal segments [m, n, ŋ] can constitute full syllables, as in [m31puŋ33] the wind, [n31tan33] a bow, [ŋ33kau33] part [of some whole]. Lexical contrasts among onsets are illustrated in Table 24.2.\n1.2 Rhymes\nThere are eighty-eight rhymes, including ten simple vowels, eight diphthongs, and seventy rhymes with consonantal codas. They are displayed in Table 24.3.\nCodas [-p, -t, -k, -ʔ ] are unreleased. The neutral vowel [W] in reduced syllables assimilates to certain onsets. After [w], the vowel in a reduced syllable is [u] or [u]; after [ts] or [s], it is\n401\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n2.2 Word and syllable structure\nMonomorphemic words are almost always monosyllabic or disyllabic, with verbs tending to be monosyllabic and nouns tending to be disyllabic in basic vocabulary. Monosyllables are always heavy, being headed either by phonetically long vowels or phonetically short vowels followed by coda consonants. A large number of disyllables take the form of the iambic or ‘sesquisyllabic’ structure (Matisoff 1973), consisting of a major (heavy) syllable preceded by a minor (light) syllable with reduced phonemic possibilities. The examples given in Table 53.3 illustrate the Jinghpaw word structures.\nThe major syllable allows up to two prenuclear consonants and one postnuclear con­ sonant, so that the maximal structure is C]C2vc3, plus a tone, c, may be any consonant in the inventory when c2 is not filled. Sonority must increase in the onset. Two sonorants /r/ and lyl may occur as c2 when the preceding consonant is a stop (bilabial, velar) or nasal (bilabial, alveolar), except for the combination of a nasal plus /r/. The optional coda con­ sonant (c3) can be /p, t, k, ?, m, n, q, w, y/, where /k/ is mostly restricted to loanwords, as the Proto-Tibeto-Burman (PTB) coda *k has developed into 111 in modem Jinghpaw (Benedict 1972: 14). The four diphthongs, ui, oi, ai, au, can be interpreted phonologically as a sequence o f a vowel plus a glide, i.e. /uy/, /oy/, /ay/, /aw/, based on the fact that they never occur in closed syllables. The vowel-coda combination (vc3) is basically free, except when v is a schwa or when c3 is a glide.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III.

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs.

When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

My fieldwork was sup­ ported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Nos. 24-2938 and 26-2254) from the Japan Society for the Promotion o f Science (JSPS).\n2 Example sentences are mostly taken from Jinghpaw Readers and the Jinghpaw Bible, which provide a rich exemplification of verbal endings lost in modem spoken Jingh­ paw (see section 5.4.1.6).\n3 Because o f the complex conditions and allomorphy, personal indices are treated as portmanteau with morphemes marking direction, intensity, possessor agreement, and mood in most previous studies, including Hanson (1896), Dai and Xu (1992), and Dai (2012), which employ quite a large number of paradigms or lists to represent them, with the exception of DeLancey (1980, 2011).\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n"

For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’.

Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion.

The element expressing the superset could be either [a free pronoun, an index](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) or a plural noun/proper noun. \nAn example: in ***We Harald** talked* ‘Harald and I talked.’, the free 1PL pronoun *we* is a superset, and included within that is the subset which is the 1SG referent (the ‘I’ in the translation) and the proper noun *Harald*. In some languages, this construction may involve associative duals and plurals. This feature includes implicit inclusory constructions (as seen above) and explicit inclusory constructions which may have an overt inclusory marker in the construction to further mark the inclusory construction. The subset can be expressed with different word classes such as proper nouns, numerals, demonstratives, etc. Inclusory constructions often take the form of nominal coordination constructions.\n\n",

                "content": "5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event; goal of movement; possessor\n\ntha? locative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event; goal of movement; standard of\n\ncomparison\n\n?e\n\nlocative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event\n\nde? allative\n\ngoal of movement; location of existence and event; time of event\n\nhna ablative\n\nsource of movement; location of emergence\n\nkhu perlative path; means\n\n?d? genitive\n\npossessor\n\nna\n\ngenitive\n\npossessor\n\nthe? comitative co-participant of s/a (companion and reciprocant); instrument; means; material\n\n5.4 The verb complex\nThe verb complex of Jinghpaw is fairly complex, the most expanded form of which may consist of a sequence of verbs followed by a string of various kinds of auxiliaries, which in turn are followed by verbal endings marking verbal categories such as direction, as well as such inflectional categories as number, person, aspect, and mood.\n\n5.4.1 Verbal endings\n\nVerbal endings are manifested as affixes or phonologically independent words, all of which occur after verbs in a fixed linear order. The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n(13) a. sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nb. sa\n\ns-it-0.\n\ngo/come VEN-2nd-iMP go/come AND-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here!’\n\n‘Go away!’\n\nOther morphemes that occupy the same slot include /- ‘pa’ and n- ‘intns.’The morpheme /- ‘pa’ is used to signal agreement with a possessor of an argument, as in (10). Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event; goal of movement; possessor\n\ntha? locative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event; goal of movement; standard of\n\ncomparison\n\n?e\n\nlocative\n\nlocation of existence and event; time of event\n\nde? allative\n\ngoal of movement; location of existence and event; time of event\n\nhna ablative\n\nsource of movement; location of emergence\n\nkhu perlative path; means\n\n?d? genitive\n\npossessor\n\nna\n\ngenitive\n\npossessor\n\nthe? comitative co-participant of s/a (companion and reciprocant); instrument; means; material\n\n5.4 The verb complex\nThe verb complex of Jinghpaw is fairly complex, the most expanded form of which may consist of a sequence of verbs followed by a string of various kinds of auxiliaries, which in turn are followed by verbal endings marking verbal categories such as direction, as well as such inflectional categories as number, person, aspect, and mood.\n\n5.4.1 Verbal endings\n\nVerbal endings are manifested as affixes or phonologically independent words, all of which occur after verbs in a fixed linear order. The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n\nCOMPL p l-s c M -P A -2 n d\n\n‘Your heart is filled with grief.’\n\ntha? yon-khyen loc moum-distress\nd-ay.\n2nd-D E C L\n\nPay NMLZ\n\n5.4.1.1 Number\nNumber marking is manifested by means of prefixation. Plural number (including dual) is overtly marked by a prefix ma- (m- before a vowel). There is no overt marker for sin­ gular. Plural number may also be marked by ga? for 1st person in certain environments (see section 5.4.1.4).\n( 11) eanthe tjay phe? h-madat na m-a?

The change o f state aspect, manifested by a prefix sa- (s- before vowels), marks a change o f state, whether it is the onset or endpoint. The non-change of state aspect, which is not marked overtly, marks any other situation. The change o f state prefix changes the following tone to high when it is a checked syllable.\n\n(12) khokham go si mat\n\nking\n\ntop die compl\n\n‘The king has passed away.’\n\ns-0-ay. scM-3rd-DECL\n\n5.4.1.3 Direction\n\nOptional morphemes marking such categories as direction, intensity, and possessor agreement may intervene between the verb and morphemes marking inflectional cate­ gories. AH the morphemes which occupy this slot consist of a single consonant, includ­ ing /'- ‘ven,’ s- ‘and,’ l- ‘pa,’ and n- ‘intns.’ Jinghpaw has grammaticalized a binary category of direction. The venitive (cislocative) r- marks motion toward the deictic center and the andative (translocative) s- marks motion away from the deictic center, as exemplified by a minimal pair below (see DeLancey 1980, for further discussion). Observe in the examples that the Jinghpaw verb sa is deictically neutral, meaning both ‘go’ and ‘come,’ and the direction of movement is morphologically marked by the directional markers.\n\n(13) a. sa\n\nr-it-0.\n"

A reflexive marker can be derived from pronouns with reflexive morphology (e.g. *him-self* in English, *lui-même* in French). If reflexive meaning is expressed with a body part noun, e.g. a noun meaning ‘body’ or ‘head’ (*They are scolding their body* to mean ‘They are scolding themselves’), this also counts as 1. Emphatic pronouns (e.g. *She cooked it (by) herself.*) do not trigger a 1, since they do not express a participant.\n\n",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

My fieldwork was sup­ ported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Nos. 24-2938 and 26-2254) from the Japan Society for the Promotion o f Science (JSPS).\n2 Example sentences are mostly taken from Jinghpaw Readers and the Jinghpaw Bible, which provide a rich exemplification of verbal endings lost in modem spoken Jingh­ paw (see section 5.4.1.6).\n3 Because o f the complex conditions and allomorphy, personal indices are treated as portmanteau with morphemes marking direction, intensity, possessor agreement, and mood in most previous studies, including Hanson (1896), Dai and Xu (1992), and Dai (2012), which employ quite a large number of paradigms or lists to represent them, with the exception of DeLancey (1980, 2011).\n"

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person.

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking. Note that the 2nd person prefix h- apparently came from nay ‘you’ or\n\nTABLE 53.4 PROPERTIES OF NOUN SUBCLASSES\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) 00 (f) (g) (h) (0 (i)\n\ncommon nouns\n\nyes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes some\n\nnumerals\n\nyes yes yes no yes yes yes yes no yes\n\ndemonstratives\n\nyes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\npersonal pronouns\n\nyes yes some yes no no no no no no\n\ninterrogative pronouns yes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\nlocator nouns\n\nyes yes no\n\nno yes yes yes no no no\n\npostpositions\n\nyes no no\n\nno yes yes yes no no some\n\n\f1000 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS\n\nSingular ( n o m )\n\nSingular ( g e n )\n\n1st\n\nnay\n\n2nd\n\nnag\n\n3rd\n\nei\n\nnye? na? ei?\n\nDual\nPan nan ean\n\nPlural\n?anlhe nanthe eanthe\n\nna? ‘your.’ Less apparent, the 3rd person prefix ga- seems to have a historical connection to the 3rd person pronoun which is pronounced khyi in some Jinghpaw varieties (Dai and Xu 1992: 23), suggesting a sound change *khyi > ei in Standard Jinghpaw.\n\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nSuffixed to pronouns or nouns, [-the33] yields a plural form. For example, with [n33tai33] ‘this’; ‘this one’ it yields the [n33tai33the33] ‘these’; with [nau33] ‘younger brother’ it yields [nau33the33] ‘younger brothers’. The suffix [-la31] marks animal nouns as male, [-ji31] as female: with [u31] ‘chicken’, ‘fowl’ they form [u31la31] ‘cockrel’, ‘rooster’ and [u31ji31] ‘hen’ respectively.\n2.2 Word classes\nThe words of Jinghpo can be classified into twelve categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, numerals, measure words, adverbs, manner adverbs (MAs), postpositions, conjunctions, and sentence-final words (SFWs). We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n\nIn contrast to common nouns, which take a full range of adnominals, closed classes of nouns cannot take the same range of adnominals. Demonstratives and personal pronouns, for example, only allow post-adnominals. Table 53.4 summarizes the properties of noun sub­ classes in terms of whether a given noun: (a) can be the head of an np; (b) can occur on its own; (c) can be pluralized by the plural marker; (d) can be quantified by a numeral; (e) can be determinated by a pre-head demonstrative; (f) can be preceded by a relative clause; (g) can be preceded by a genitive phrase; (h) can be determinated by a post-head demonstra­ tive; (i) can be modified by an adjective; or (j) can be involved in partial reduplication.\n\n5.2.1 Demonstratives\nJinghpaw demonstratives are distinguished in terms of speaker/addressee orientation, rel­ ative distance, and height from the speaker: nday [proximal; speaker-centered]; day [proximal; addressee-centered]; wd-ra [distal; level]; tho-ra [distal; up]; le-ra [distal; down], the latter three of which involve eara ‘place.’Demonstratives may occur in pre- or post-head positions, except when they modify locator nouns or postpositions, in which case only pre-head position is grammatical. Only proximal demonstratives may be used for anaphora or cataphora.\n"

As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion.

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.2 Personalpronouns\nThe personal pronoun system exhibits three-way splits in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural), yielding the paradigm given in Table 53.5. There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking. Note that the 2nd person prefix h- apparently came from nay ‘you’ or\n\nTABLE 53.4 PROPERTIES OF NOUN SUBCLASSES\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) 00 (f) (g) (h) (0 (i)\n\ncommon nouns\n\nyes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes some\n\nnumerals\n\nyes yes yes no yes yes yes yes no yes\n\ndemonstratives\n\nyes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\npersonal pronouns\n\nyes yes some yes no no no no no no\n\ninterrogative pronouns yes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\nlocator nouns\n\nyes yes no\n\nno yes yes yes no no no\n\npostpositions\n\nyes no no\n\nno yes yes yes no no some\n\n\f1000 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS\n\nSingular ( n o m )\n\nSingular ( g e n )\n\n1st\n\nnay\n\n2nd\n\nnag\n\n3rd\n\nei\n\nnye? na? ei?\n\nDual\nPan nan ean\n\nPlural\n?anlhe nanthe eanthe\n\nna? ‘your.’ Less apparent, the 3rd person prefix ga- seems to have a historical connection to the 3rd person pronoun which is pronounced khyi in some Jinghpaw varieties (Dai and Xu 1992: 23), suggesting a sound change *khyi > ei in Standard Jinghpaw.\n\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nThe minor syllable is headed either by a phonetically short schwa h i or a syllabic nasal, represented by Ini in this chapter, which assimilates to place of articulation o f the following consonants. The fact that the minor syllable never occurs word-finally, together with the fact that the first syllable o f a disyllabic word is sometimes reduced to a minor syllable, e.g. ginsup ‘play’ —>gasup, as well as the fact that a monosyllabic prefix, when prefixed to a monosyllabic base, is sometimes reduced to a minor syllable retaining its original tone, e.g. ?a-ldy [ADv-easy] —>?a-loy ‘easily,’ indicates a consistent iambic pat­ tern for Jinghpaw prosody. The schwa-headed minor syllable, which is always light and open and does not allow complex onsets, has a reduced set o f onset consonants, the most frequent of which include /g, ?, e, m, 1/. The consonants /dz, n, rj, r/ never occur in this position. The syllabicity o f the syllabic nasal can be evidenced by observing: (a) that it bears a tone; (b) that it cannot be prefixed by monosyllable-targeting prefixes; (c) that it is not copied in partial reduplication; (d) that it is assigned one musical beat, just like a\n"

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9.

As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above.

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others.

Lexical contrasts among these rhymes are illustrated in Table 24.4.\n1.3 Tones\nThere are four tones altogether. Tone 1 is marked as a high level tone, e.g. [mu55] ‘work’, [kW55wa55] ‘bamboo’, but only in laryngealized syllables is it actually pronounced as a high level tone ([pai55] left (as opposed to right)); in non-laryngealized syllables it is pronounced as a mid-to-high rising tone ([pai35] again). Tone 2 is a mid level tone: [mu33] ‘delicious’, [wa33] ‘tooth’. Tone 3 is a low falling tone: [mu31] ‘to see’, [wa31] ‘to return’. Tone 4 falls from a high pitch across the full pitch range to a low pitch: [nu51] ‘mother’ (term of direct address), [wa51] ‘father’ (term of direct address). All four tones occur in unchecked syllables, while checked syllables are either the high level tone or the low falling tone.

Type 5 is C + V + V + T: [nai31] ‘taro’. Type 6 is C + V + C + T: [naŋ33] you (singular). Type 7, which involves syllabic nasals, is C + T: [n55] ‘not’.\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation",

Otherwise it is [ə] or [ß]. In the high level tone some laryngealized vowels alternate with nonlaryngealized variants. For example, [ka55] alternates with [ka55] as earth, place. Lexical contrasts among these rhymes are illustrated in Table 24.4.\n1.3 Tones\nThere are four tones altogether. Tone 1 is marked as a high level tone, e.g. [mu55] ‘work’, [kW55wa55] ‘bamboo’, but only in laryngealized syllables is it actually pronounced as a high level tone ([pai55] left (as opposed to right)); in non-laryngealized syllables it is pronounced as a mid-to-high rising tone ([pai35] again). Tone 2 is a mid level tone: [mu33] ‘delicious’, [wa33] ‘tooth’. Tone 3 is a low falling tone: [mu31] ‘to see’, [wa31] ‘to return’. Tone 4 falls from a high pitch across the full pitch range to a low pitch: [nu51] ‘mother’ (term of direct address), [wa51] ‘father’ (term of direct address). All four tones occur in unchecked syllables, while checked syllables are either the high level tone or the low falling tone. The great preponderance of high-to-low falling tones occur as a result of sandhi. For example, the expression combining [n55] ‘not with’ [wa31] ‘to return’ is [n55 wa51] ‘not to return’.\n1.4 Syllable structure\nSeven types of syllable structures occur. Type 1 is V + T (vowel with tone): [aʔ31] [X]’s. Type 2 is V + V + T: [ai31] ‘very’. Type 3 is V + C + T (vowel plus consonant with tone): [aŋ31] appropriate. Type 4 is C + V + T: [na33] ‘ear’. Type 5 is C + V + V + T: [nai31] ‘taro’. Type 6 is C + V + C + T: [naŋ33] you (singular). Type 7, which involves syllabic nasals, is C + T: [n55] ‘not’.\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJinghpo has been analysed as having thirty-one syllable onsets; they are displayed in Table 24.1.

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

This feature contrasts with [GB166 Is there a productive morphological paucal marker on nouns?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB166)) which focuses on bound marking of paucal number. For more on wordhood and bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). \n\nNumber marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and still be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking.

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs.

Grammatical marking of evidentials involves the use of grammaticalized markers such as affixes or other morphology, evidential particles, or evidential auxiliary verbs to convey the evidential meaning. Grammatical marking contrasts with constructions that express this meaning by means of adverbs (e.g. *John **apparently** ate the cake*) or lexical verbs in multi-clausal constructions (e.g. *I **saw** that John had eaten the cake*). Visual evidence is a common form of information encoded with a direct evidential, however direct evidentiality may also include auditory or other non-visual categories of sensory evidence.

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nPay] ray NMLZ COP\n\nhna. . .

My fieldwork was sup­ ported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Nos. 24-2938 and 26-2254) from the Japan Society for the Promotion o f Science (JSPS).\n2 Example sentences are mostly taken from Jinghpaw Readers and the Jinghpaw Bible, which provide a rich exemplification of verbal endings lost in modem spoken Jingh­ paw (see section 5.4.1.6).\n3 Because o f the complex conditions and allomorphy, personal indices are treated as portmanteau with morphemes marking direction, intensity, possessor agreement, and mood in most previous studies, including Hanson (1896), Dai and Xu (1992), and Dai (2012), which employ quite a large number of paradigms or lists to represent them, with the exception of DeLancey (1980, 2011).\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nThe Jinghpaw person indexation system is based on both grammatical roles and a person hierarchy in which SAPs outrank a 3rd person (SAP > 3rd). Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’\n"

            "summary": "This question is concerned with the marking of evidentiality related to the speaker's indirect, non-sensory evidence for some event or action. Grammatical marking of evidentials involves the use of grammaticalized markers such as affixes or other morphology, evidential particles, or evidential auxiliary verbs to convey the evidential meaning, in contrast to constructions that create this meaning through the use of adverbs (e.g. *John **reportedly** ate the cake*) or lexical verbs in multi-clause constructions (e.g. *They **say** that John ate the cake*). Indirect evidentiality usually involves inference from physical evidence or second-hand knowledge such as hearsay. This question should be coded 1 if there is a single category of indirect evidentiality or any number of inferential or reportative evidential categories that are marked grammatically.\n\n",

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9.

As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun.

Languages that have at least one form that means either ‘how much' (of a mass noun) or ‘how many' (of a count noun), but not the alternative, are considered to have a count/mass distinction in interrogative quantifiers.

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nverbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs.

As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’\n\ne. ei? ga-phii ‘his/her brother’ f. eanthe ?a? ga-phu ‘their brother’\n\n5.2.3 Numerals and classifiers\n\nJinghpaw has a decimal numeral system, as is the case with many other TB languages. Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun.

Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural.

Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n"

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

[ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2 The noun phrase\n\nWithin an np, genitive and relative modifiers occur in the pre-head position, while modi­ fiers such as an adjective, plural marker ni, numeral and classifier occur in the post-head position, as in (4). A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.5 Nominalization and subordination\nThe pervasive use and multifunctionality of clausal nominalization is a prominent feature of Jinghpaw grammar. Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d?

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n"

Do not consider correlative relative clauses for this feature (see [GB330](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB330)). A relative clause is a type of clause that serves to modify a noun.

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below.

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun.

Numerals follow the nouns they refer to. The Kachin numerals, strictly speaking, do not go beyond a hundred ; to express 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, &c., the Shan or Chinese word for the same is borrowed.\n\nLangai = 1. Lakhawng = 2.

It is hard to find a Kachin who can correctly count up to 100,000, and beyond this he is completely out of his depth.\n\nWan mi (the Chinese wan, = 100,000) is sometimes given for 1,000,000.\nLan mi (the Shan for 1,000,000) is occasionally given correctly.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/hertz_kachin1902_o.txt'}\nADVERBIAL NUMERALS.\n45. Firstly, secondly, &c., are expressed in the following manner :—•\nBy adding gaw to shawng or shawng de (before), or to hpang or hpangde htawrn or htawrn de (behind).\nShawng de gaw = firstly. Hpang de gaw = lastly, but following the first it would mean\nsecondly. Hpang de gaw, following the numerals, three, four, &c., would\nmean fourthly, fifthly, &c. Twice, thrice, &c., are commonly expressed by adding lang (occasion or repetition of any thing) to the ordinal numbers as lakhawng lang twice or two times, masum lang, thrice or three times, &c, Once is expressed by langmiov kalangmi from lang and mi {see section) 43). It is never expressed by adding lang\\x> the numeral one.\n\nPREPOSITIONS.\n\n46. Prepositions follow the nouns they refer to—\n\nHpe (abbreviated form e) ... ‘to’ (dative particle).\n\n* De (abbreviated form e)\n\n... ‘to,’ ‘in,’ or ‘at’ a place (loca­ tive).\n\nKaw ...\n\n...\n\n... ‘to’ and is used with reference to\n\npersons in the same manner as\n\nde (to) with reference to\n\nn 13 p p c\n\n* Na ...\n\n...\n\n... ‘from,’‘of,’ ‘out of.’\n\nHta ...\n\n....\n\n... ‘in-’\n\nHte ...\n\n..-\n\n... ‘with’ (used as a conjunction\n\n‘ and ’).\n\nMakau ...\n\n...\n\n... ‘by,’ ‘near.’\n\nExamples.\nNgai hpe shi hpa n jaw ai = He gave nothing to me.

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun.

            "summary": "\nBody-part tallying systems are counting systems that use body parts other than hands, feet, fingers or toes. Counting starts from one hand, tallying parts of the body along the arm, up to the head and then continuing with symmetric tally points down the other side of the body. Body-part tallying systems are usually only used in some social situations, such as traditional bride price negotiations. Some languages with decimal, quinary or vigesimal systems use words for *head* or *body* to represent *10* or *20*, the word for *hand* to mean *5* or the word for *eye* to mean *1*. These do not count as body-part tallying systems in the absence of a sequence of other body-part tally points. \n\n",

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.2 Personalpronouns\nThe personal pronoun system exhibits three-way splits in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural), yielding the paradigm given in Table 53.5.

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking.

Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.2 Personalpronouns\nThe personal pronoun system exhibits three-way splits in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural), yielding the paradigm given in Table 53.5. There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking. Note that the 2nd person prefix h- apparently came from nay ‘you’ or\n\nTABLE 53.4 PROPERTIES OF NOUN SUBCLASSES\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) 00 (f) (g) (h) (0 (i)\n\ncommon nouns\n\nyes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes some\n\nnumerals\n\nyes yes yes no yes yes yes yes no yes\n\ndemonstratives\n\nyes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\npersonal pronouns\n\nyes yes some yes no no no no no no\n\ninterrogative pronouns yes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\nlocator nouns\n\nyes yes no\n\nno yes yes yes no no no\n\npostpositions\n\nyes no no\n\nno yes yes yes no no some\n\n\f1000 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS\n\nSingular ( n o m )\n\nSingular ( g e n )\n\n1st\n\nnay\n\n2nd\n\nnag\n\n3rd\n\nei\n\nnye? na? ei?\n\nDual\nPan nan ean\n\nPlural\n?anlhe nanthe eanthe\n\nna? ‘your.’ Less apparent, the 3rd person prefix ga- seems to have a historical connection to the 3rd person pronoun which is pronounced khyi in some Jinghpaw varieties (Dai and Xu 1992: 23), suggesting a sound change *khyi > ei in Standard Jinghpaw.\n\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 407\n\nmodify ordinary verbs; they modify only certain generalised verbs (GVs) such as [ti33], [ ai31], [ŋa33], [ŋu55] and [ e33].\n\n(1) ʃi33 ŋjan31\n\nai31 wa31 mat31\n\nsai33\n\n3SG dilly-dally GV return completive SFW\n\n‘He took his time going back.’\n\n(2) n31luŋ31 theʔ 31 mjet55\n\nti33 kW31mjet55\n\nstone INST press-press GV press\n\n‘Press it with the stone really hard!’\n\nton31\n\nuʔ 31\n\nleave (in a place) SFW\n\nPostpositions are structural particles such as [eʔ 55], [aʔ 31] and [e31] used following objects, adnominal modifiers, and other constituents to mark relationships among sentence constituents, as in the following examples.\n\n(3) ŋai33 ʃi33 eʔ 55 ja33 sW33ŋai33 1SG 3SG OBJ give SFW ‘I gave it to him.’\n\n(4) ŋai33-nau33\n\naʔ 31 lai31ka33\n\n1SGPOSS-younger.brother GEN book\n\n‘My younger brother’s book.’\n\n(5) ʃW31wa31mW31ʃa31 e31\n\nim31 ton31\n\nthe.masses\n\nAGT capture set down and leave [in a fixed place]\n\n‘To be seized by the masses.’\n\nThe SFW has numerous inflected forms. Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1006 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nspeaker puts one participant in focus, while the latter is used when the speaker focuses on two participants (Scott DeLancey, personal communication).

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T\n"

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

A-lability stands for agent-preserving lability, that is the A argument is preserved in the intransitive construction, as in _**John**_[A] _drinks tea / **John** drinks_. \n\nThis question asks only about P-labile verbs. Semantically, two things can happen with P-labile verbs. In case of (a) argument structure modifying P-lability, an otherwise transitive verb is used in the intransitive construction encoding an argument structure from which the A argument of the transitive construction is absent. In case of (b) less common argument structure preserving P-lability, the verb in its intransitive use implies the same participants with the same roles as in its transitive use, but in the intransitive use, the A argument is not expressed and is interpreted as non-specific.\n\n",

Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit?

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase\n"

These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

            "summary": "This question concerns  strong suppletion in verbs of coming. Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm. An example of this is English _went_ and _go_. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. ‘Weak’ suppletion is not included. \n\n",

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.4.2 Verb serialization\n\nJinghpaw verbs can be serialized productively, without any overt marker o f coordination or subordination, constituting a single predicate.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person.

The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types.

Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9.

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1006 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nspeaker puts one participant in focus, while the latter is used when the speaker focuses on two participants (Scott DeLancey, personal communication).

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nThe Jinghpaw person indexation system is based on both grammatical roles and a person hierarchy in which SAPs outrank a 3rd person (SAP > 3rd). Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III.

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n"

The examples show that A arguments are marked with an accusative (ACC) case marker 'phe?' which is not used for S arguments. This suggests an ergative alignment of flagging. Additionally, the information on verb agreement supports this as it mentions different indexation patterns based on argument configurations. Therefore, according to the procedure, Southern Jinghpaw should be coded as 1 for showing ergative alignment in flagging.",

Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n"

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

            "summary": "This feature asks whether there are different second person pronoun forms that are used based on the level of respect accorded by the speaker to the addressee. In some cases polite pronouns are used to indicate a level of formality or unfamiliarity between speaker and addressee. In other cases politeness distinctions are used according to very specific social relationships between speaker and addressee, such as relative age, social status, or kinship. If multiple second person pronoun forms exist in a single number category, and their use is patterned according to the level of intimacy or hierarchy of social relationship between speaker and addressee, this will suffice for a 1 code. The contrastive forms may or may not have other uses (e.g. in French the form *tu* is used only for second person singular informal, while *vous* is used for both second person singular polite and second person plural); a politeness distinction triggers a 1 for this feature regardless of whether the relevant forms have other functions/meanings.\n\n",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking. Note that the 2nd person prefix h- apparently came from nay ‘you’ or\n\nTABLE 53.4 PROPERTIES OF NOUN SUBCLASSES\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) 00 (f) (g) (h) (0 (i)\n\ncommon nouns\n\nyes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes some\n\nnumerals\n\nyes yes yes no yes yes yes yes no yes\n\ndemonstratives\n\nyes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\npersonal pronouns\n\nyes yes some yes no no no no no no\n\ninterrogative pronouns yes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\nlocator nouns\n\nyes yes no\n\nno yes yes yes no no no\n\npostpositions\n\nyes no no\n\nno yes yes yes no no some\n\n\f1000 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS\n\nSingular ( n o m )\n\nSingular ( g e n )\n\n1st\n\nnay\n\n2nd\n\nnag\n\n3rd\n\nei\n\nnye? na? ei?\n\nDual\nPan nan ean\n\nPlural\n?anlhe nanthe eanthe\n\nna? ‘your.’ Less apparent, the 3rd person prefix ga- seems to have a historical connection to the 3rd person pronoun which is pronounced khyi in some Jinghpaw varieties (Dai and Xu 1992: 23), suggesting a sound change *khyi > ei in Standard Jinghpaw.\n\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nObserve in the table that the number category for 1st person is formally distin­ guished only in Set I, and the category is neutralized in Sets II and III. Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1006 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nspeaker puts one participant in focus, while the latter is used when the speaker focuses on two participants (Scott DeLancey, personal communication).

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nTABLE 24.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS\n\nSingular\n\nFirst person Second person Third person (oral usage) Third person (written usage)\n\nŋai33 naŋ 33 khji33\nʃ i33\n\nDual\nan55 nan55 khan55 ʃ an55\n\nPlural\nan55the33 nan55the33 khan55the33 ʃ an55the33\n"

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking.

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n"

This frequently takes the form of a genitive prefix on a possessor, but may also involve other types of prefixes or proclitics. Crucially, the possession must be marked by an element that precedes and is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) to the possessor nominal/pronominal.\n\n",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 405\nfood’, ‘leftovers’; likewise, [luʔ 31] ‘to drink’ follows [khaʔ 31] water in [luʔ 31khaʔ 31] ‘drinking water’. In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.2.2 Personalpronouns\nThe personal pronoun system exhibits three-way splits in person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular, dual, plural), yielding the paradigm given in Table 53.5. There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below.

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking. Note that the 2nd person prefix h- apparently came from nay ‘you’ or\n\nTABLE 53.4 PROPERTIES OF NOUN SUBCLASSES\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) 00 (f) (g) (h) (0 (i)\n\ncommon nouns\n\nyes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes some\n\nnumerals\n\nyes yes yes no yes yes yes yes no yes\n\ndemonstratives\n\nyes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\npersonal pronouns\n\nyes yes some yes no no no no no no\n\ninterrogative pronouns yes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\nlocator nouns\n\nyes yes no\n\nno yes yes yes no no no\n\npostpositions\n\nyes no no\n\nno yes yes yes no no some\n\n\f1000 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS\n\nSingular ( n o m )\n\nSingular ( g e n )\n\n1st\n\nnay\n\n2nd\n\nnag\n\n3rd\n\nei\n\nnye? na? ei?\n\nDual\nPan nan ean\n\nPlural\n?anlhe nanthe eanthe\n\nna? ‘your.’ Less apparent, the 3rd person prefix ga- seems to have a historical connection to the 3rd person pronoun which is pronounced khyi in some Jinghpaw varieties (Dai and Xu 1992: 23), suggesting a sound change *khyi > ei in Standard Jinghpaw.\n\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’\n"

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

            "summary": "This feature covers all grammatical moods (the relationship between the referred event/state/action and reality and/or speakers' attitude toward what they are saying) and aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) elements that do not inflect (i.e. do not change form depending on person, number and other categories of the core arguments). These markers are often described as ‘[particles](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles)' in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking. \n\nThere are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that a mood is expressed by a certain form on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing mood then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB519) and the feature on bound mood marking ([GB312](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB312)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing a mood, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.\n\nWhile negation or interrogation can be considered as grammatical moods, they are not included in this feature.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Look up the section on mood marking in the grammatical description.\n2. Consider all marking of mood, e.g. not only conditional.\n3. If you do not find any non-inflecting phonologically free mood markers, code as 0.\n4. If there is a non-inflecting phonologically free marker that clearly marks mood, code the language as 1.\n5.

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/qingxia-diehl_jingpho2003_s.txt'}\nJINGHPO 407\n\nmodify ordinary verbs; they modify only certain generalised verbs (GVs) such as [ti33], [ ai31], [ŋa33], [ŋu55] and [ e33].\n\n(1) ʃi33 ŋjan31\n\nai31 wa31 mat31\n\nsai33\n\n3SG dilly-dally GV return completive SFW\n\n‘He took his time going back.’\n\n(2) n31luŋ31 theʔ 31 mjet55\n\nti33 kW31mjet55\n\nstone INST press-press GV press\n\n‘Press it with the stone really hard!’\n\nton31\n\nuʔ 31\n\nleave (in a place) SFW\n\nPostpositions are structural particles such as [eʔ 55], [aʔ 31] and [e31] used following objects, adnominal modifiers, and other constituents to mark relationships among sentence constituents, as in the following examples.\n\n(3) ŋai33 ʃi33 eʔ 55 ja33 sW33ŋai33 1SG 3SG OBJ give SFW ‘I gave it to him.’\n\n(4) ŋai33-nau33\n\naʔ 31 lai31ka33\n\n1SGPOSS-younger.brother GEN book\n\n‘My younger brother’s book.’\n\n(5) ʃW31wa31mW31ʃa31 e31\n\nim31 ton31\n\nthe.masses\n\nAGT capture set down and leave [in a fixed place]\n\n‘To be seized by the masses.’\n\nThe SFW has numerous inflected forms.

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’.

For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’.

When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a?

We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull\n\nCOMPL p l-s c M -P A -2 n d\n\n‘Your heart is filled with grief.’\n\ntha? yon-khyen loc moum-distress\nd-ay.\n2nd-D E C L\n\nPay NMLZ\n\n5.4.1.1 Number\nNumber marking is manifested by means of prefixation.

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n1006 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nspeaker puts one participant in focus, while the latter is used when the speaker focuses on two participants (Scott DeLancey, personal communication).

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T\n{'source': 'resources/southern_jinghpaw/kurabe_jinghpaw2017_o.txt'}\n5.4.2 Verb serialization\n\nJinghpaw verbs can be serialized productively, without any overt marker o f coordination or subordination, constituting a single predicate. Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a?
