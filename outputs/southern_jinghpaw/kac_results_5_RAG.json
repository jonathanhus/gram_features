Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd?

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37).

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.",

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37).

This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

[ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Monosyllables are always heavy, being headed either by phonetically long vowels or phonetically short vowels followed by coda consonants. A large number of disyllables take the form of the iambic or ‘sesquisyllabic’ structure (Matisoff 1973), consisting of a major (heavy) syllable preceded by a minor (light) syllable with reduced phonemic possibilities. The examples given in Table 53.3 illustrate the Jinghpaw word structures.\nThe major syllable allows up to two prenuclear consonants and one postnuclear con­ sonant, so that the maximal structure is C]C2vc3, plus a tone, c, may be any consonant in the inventory when c2 is not filled. Sonority must increase in the onset. Two sonorants /r/ and lyl may occur as c2 when the preceding consonant is a stop (bilabial, velar) or nasal (bilabial, alveolar), except for the combination of a nasal plus /r/. The optional coda con­ sonant (c3) can be /p, t, k, ?, m, n, q, w, y/, where /k/ is mostly restricted to loanwords, as the Proto-Tibeto-Burman (PTB) coda *k has developed into 111 in modem Jinghpaw (Benedict 1972: 14). The four diphthongs, ui, oi, ai, au, can be interpreted phonologically as a sequence o f a vowel plus a glide, i.e. /uy/, /oy/, /ay/, /aw/, based on the fact that they never occur in closed syllables. The vowel-coda combination (vc3) is basically free, except when v is a schwa or when c3 is a glide.",

                "content": "2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship.

The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9.

As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs.

As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

                "content": "2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

                "content": "2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9.

As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs.

As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’.

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship.

The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

                "content": "2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a?

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

Kdsha = A child. La kdsha = K male child. Num kdsha = A female child. Shadang sha = K son. Shayi sha = K daughter.\n17 (a). A lusty young man is sometimes called a gwila. There is no feminine term corresponding to gwila.\n18. But in the case of proper nouns of common gender the words la and num denoting the gender follow the noun as a rule.\nExamples.\nMyen la = A.

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Compound nouns are formed by uniting nouns as shanhpi, leather, from shdn a common term for wild animals and hpi the skin, and by other combinations which are self-explanatory, as dut aiwa, the seller, from dut ai to sell and wa a person, &c.\n8. Monosyllabic nouns are frequently prefixed by a. Example : ja dja, gold ; na, dna, elder sister.\n(zz) When terms of relationship are prefixed by ning or n, their re­ lation to a second person is indicated. Example : hpu, elder brother; mighpu or nhpu, the elder brother of the person spoken to.\n(£) When prefixed by ka, their relation to a third person is indicat­ ed. Example : nau, younger brother ; kanau, the younger brother of the person spoken of.\nThe prefix kd is occasionally used in place of ning or n. It is, strictly speaking, incorrect to do so and its use in this manner should be avoided.\n(c) The prefixes ning, n and kd are used only with monosyllabic terms of relationship.\nForming the Plural.\n9. A general plural is most commonly formed by adding wz’tothe noun. Example : ma a child, ma ni children ; kumra a pony, kumra ni ponies.\n10. The plural is implied when nouns are followed by adjectives like all, some, many, and the numerals and the plural sign ni can be omitted.\nExamples.\nGwiyawngwau ai = All dogs (literally ‘dog’) bark. Nlong nkau grai ja ai = Some stones are very hard. Sdnat khun=Twenty guns. 11. The plural affix ni may, however, be used with adjectives that imply the plural.\nExamples.\nChingpaw nkau ) =Sorae men. Chingpaw nt nkau j 12. When a numeral follows a noun the affix ni is not used, except if the numeral be qualified by ddram or taram. (about), when the affix may be used.\nExamples.",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used.

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted.

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.",

                "content": "2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

                "content": "The Jinghpaw person indexation system is based on both grammatical roles and a person hierarchy in which SAPs outrank a 3rd person (SAP > 3rd). Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’",

Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

This prefix distinguishes [tʃW31phai33] ‘to make (somebody) lift (something) up’ from [phai33] ‘to lift (something) up’, ‘tʃW31kh at31’ ‘to drop (something) from (kh at31) ‘(for something) to drop’, [ʃW31pa55] ‘to tire (somebody)’ from [pa55] ‘to be tired’, [ʃW31tʃe33] ‘to let (somebody) know’ from [tʃe33] ‘to know’ and [sW31tsam33] ‘to make (something) rot’, ‘decay’ from [tsam33] ‘to rot, decay’ and so on.\nA number of verbs are causativized with the prefix [a31-]: [k op31] ‘(for something) to shatter’ and [a31k op31] ‘to shatter (something)’. A few verbs distinguish the causative by suppletive alternation: [ oŋ33] ‘(for something) to be inside (something else)’ and [ oŋ55] ‘to place (something) inside (something else)’; [tʃuŋ31] ‘(for something) to be loaded with (something else)’ and [tʃun55] ‘to load (something) with (something else)’.\nThe syntactic causative construction simply places the verb [ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause’ after the non-causative verb: [sa33] ‘to go’ and [sa33 ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause to go’; [kW31lo33] ‘to do’ and [kW31lo33 ʃ W31ŋun55] ‘to cause to do’.\nVerbs can be reduplicated with the added meaning of ‘constantly, regularly’ or ‘slightly’. Compare [sa33] ‘to go’ and [sa33sa33] ‘to go on a regular basis’, or [tʃe33] ‘to know’ and [tʃe33tʃe33] ‘to know to a limited extent’.\nAuxiliary verbs are relatively numerous; they follow verbs to express the direction, progress, or nature of the action. For example, [khat55] expresses that the action is reciprocal: [kW31 um33] means ‘to help’ and [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’. The auxiliary [kh at31] specifies that the action involves downward motion: [jon33] means ‘to trickle, drip’ and [jon33 kh at31] ‘to trickle down’, ‘to drip down’.

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural.

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template.

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural.

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

My fieldwork was sup­ ported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Nos. 24-2938 and 26-2254) from the Japan Society for the Promotion o f Science (JSPS).\n2 Example sentences are mostly taken from Jinghpaw Readers and the Jinghpaw Bible, which provide a rich exemplification of verbal endings lost in modem spoken Jingh­ paw (see section 5.4.1.6).\n3 Because o f the complex conditions and allomorphy, personal indices are treated as portmanteau with morphemes marking direction, intensity, possessor agreement, and mood in most previous studies, including Hanson (1896), Dai and Xu (1992), and Dai (2012), which employ quite a large number of paradigms or lists to represent them, with the exception of DeLancey (1980, 2011).",

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

This prefix distinguishes [tʃW31phai33] ‘to make (somebody) lift (something) up’ from [phai33] ‘to lift (something) up’, ‘tʃW31kh at31’ ‘to drop (something) from (kh at31) ‘(for something) to drop’, [ʃW31pa55] ‘to tire (somebody)’ from [pa55] ‘to be tired’, [ʃW31tʃe33] ‘to let (somebody) know’ from [tʃe33] ‘to know’ and [sW31tsam33] ‘to make (something) rot’, ‘decay’ from [tsam33] ‘to rot, decay’ and so on.\nA number of verbs are causativized with the prefix [a31-]: [k op31] ‘(for something) to shatter’ and [a31k op31] ‘to shatter (something)’. A few verbs distinguish the causative by suppletive alternation: [ oŋ33] ‘(for something) to be inside (something else)’ and [ oŋ55] ‘to place (something) inside (something else)’; [tʃuŋ31] ‘(for something) to be loaded with (something else)’ and [tʃun55] ‘to load (something) with (something else)’.\nThe syntactic causative construction simply places the verb [ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause’ after the non-causative verb: [sa33] ‘to go’ and [sa33 ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause to go’; [kW31lo33] ‘to do’ and [kW31lo33 ʃ W31ŋun55] ‘to cause to do’.\nVerbs can be reduplicated with the added meaning of ‘constantly, regularly’ or ‘slightly’. Compare [sa33] ‘to go’ and [sa33sa33] ‘to go on a regular basis’, or [tʃe33] ‘to know’ and [tʃe33tʃe33] ‘to know to a limited extent’.\nAuxiliary verbs are relatively numerous; they follow verbs to express the direction, progress, or nature of the action. For example, [khat55] expresses that the action is reciprocal: [kW31 um33] means ‘to help’ and [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’. The auxiliary [kh at31] specifies that the action involves downward motion: [jon33] means ‘to trickle, drip’ and [jon33 kh at31] ‘to trickle down’, ‘to drip down’.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

A few verbs distinguish the causative by suppletive alternation: [ oŋ33] ‘(for something) to be inside (something else)’ and [ oŋ55] ‘to place (something) inside (something else)’; [tʃuŋ31] ‘(for something) to be loaded with (something else)’ and [tʃun55] ‘to load (something) with (something else)’.\nThe syntactic causative construction simply places the verb [ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause’ after the non-causative verb: [sa33] ‘to go’ and [sa33 ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause to go’; [kW31lo33] ‘to do’ and [kW31lo33 ʃ W31ŋun55] ‘to cause to do’.\nVerbs can be reduplicated with the added meaning of ‘constantly, regularly’ or ‘slightly’. Compare [sa33] ‘to go’ and [sa33sa33] ‘to go on a regular basis’, or [tʃe33] ‘to know’ and [tʃe33tʃe33] ‘to know to a limited extent’.\nAuxiliary verbs are relatively numerous; they follow verbs to express the direction, progress, or nature of the action. For example, [khat55] expresses that the action is reciprocal: [kW31 um33] means ‘to help’ and [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’.

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9.

As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T",

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template.

In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

[ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

For example, modem spoken Jinghpaw usually does not encode the person category on the verb. In this style, the 3rd person declarative mood marker Pay, which also marks verb citation and clausal nominalization, plays a versatile role, being used irrespective of\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1007\nperson o f an argument (see Kurabe 2012, for an exemplification of this style). Using the personal indices in the spoken language sounds unnatural, judged to be highly elevated style. The simplification o f verbal endings seems to be caused by language contact. As van Driem (2001: 394) puts it:\nThe use of a somewhat pidginised and grammatically simplified Kachin Jinghpaw throughout northern Burma as a lingua franca between various Kachin communities is a long-standing phenomenon, and the existence o f this pidgin clouds the original picture of the Jinghpaw languages, as many o f the dialects have been influenced by the morphologically simplified lingua franca.\nThe simplification o f the verbal ending is also reported in Jinghpaw spoken in China, especially in the variety spoken by younger speakers (Dai 2012), as well as in Singpho in Northeast India (Morey 2010).\n\n5.4.2 Verb serialization",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33",

Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted.

                "content": "2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d?

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

                "content": "2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Many nouns are formed from verbal roots by the aid of certain pre­ fixes, as abawng, a prisoner, from bawng to confine ; nsa breath, from so. to breathe ; makham, a trap, from kharn to trap, &c.\n7. Compound nouns are formed by uniting nouns as shanhpi, leather, from shdn a common term for wild animals and hpi the skin, and by other combinations which are self-explanatory, as dut aiwa, the seller, from dut ai to sell and wa a person, &c.\n8. Monosyllabic nouns are frequently prefixed by a. Example : ja dja, gold ; na, dna, elder sister.\n(zz) When terms of relationship are prefixed by ning or n, their re­ lation to a second person is indicated. Example : hpu, elder brother; mighpu or nhpu, the elder brother of the person spoken to.\n(£) When prefixed by ka, their relation to a third person is indicat­ ed. Example : nau, younger brother ; kanau, the younger brother of the person spoken of.\nThe prefix kd is occasionally used in place of ning or n. It is, strictly speaking, incorrect to do so and its use in this manner should be avoided.\n(c) The prefixes ning, n and kd are used only with monosyllabic terms of relationship.\nForming the Plural.\n9. A general plural is most commonly formed by adding wz’tothe noun. Example : ma a child, ma ni children ; kumra a pony, kumra ni ponies.\n10. The plural is implied when nouns are followed by adjectives like all, some, many, and the numerals and the plural sign ni can be omitted.\nExamples.\nGwiyawngwau ai = All dogs (literally ‘dog’) bark. Nlong nkau grai ja ai = Some stones are very hard. Sdnat khun=Twenty guns. 11. The plural affix ni may, however, be used with adjectives that imply the plural.\nExamples.\nChingpaw nkau ) =Sorae men.

The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37).

Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person.

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37).

A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’",

Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T",

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d?

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a?

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9.

As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person.

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun.

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur.

If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd?

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a?

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship.

The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33",

[ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a?

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

For example, modem spoken Jinghpaw usually does not encode the person category on the verb. In this style, the 3rd person declarative mood marker Pay, which also marks verb citation and clausal nominalization, plays a versatile role, being used irrespective of\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1007\nperson o f an argument (see Kurabe 2012, for an exemplification of this style). Using the personal indices in the spoken language sounds unnatural, judged to be highly elevated style. The simplification o f verbal endings seems to be caused by language contact. As van Driem (2001: 394) puts it:\nThe use of a somewhat pidginised and grammatically simplified Kachin Jinghpaw throughout northern Burma as a lingua franca between various Kachin communities is a long-standing phenomenon, and the existence o f this pidgin clouds the original picture of the Jinghpaw languages, as many o f the dialects have been influenced by the morphologically simplified lingua franca.\nThe simplification o f the verbal ending is also reported in Jinghpaw spoken in China, especially in the variety spoken by younger speakers (Dai 2012), as well as in Singpho in Northeast India (Morey 2010).\n\n5.4.2 Verb serialization",

                "content": "2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation\nOf monomorphemic words two kinds occur: monosyllabic and polysyllabic. Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.",

Compound nouns are formed by uniting nouns as shanhpi, leather, from shdn a common term for wild animals and hpi the skin, and by other combinations which are self-explanatory, as dut aiwa, the seller, from dut ai to sell and wa a person, &c.\n8. Monosyllabic nouns are frequently prefixed by a.

It is, strictly speaking, incorrect to do so and its use in this manner should be avoided.\n(c) The prefixes ning, n and kd are used only with monosyllabic terms of relationship.\nForming the Plural.\n9. A general plural is most commonly formed by adding wz’tothe noun. Example : ma a child, ma ni children ; kumra a pony, kumra ni ponies.\n10. The plural is implied when nouns are followed by adjectives like all, some, many, and the numerals and the plural sign ni can be omitted.\nExamples.\nGwiyawngwau ai = All dogs (literally ‘dog’) bark. Nlong nkau grai ja ai = Some stones are very hard. Sdnat khun=Twenty guns. 11. The plural affix ni may, however, be used with adjectives that imply the plural.\nExamples.\nChingpaw nkau ) =Sorae men. Chingpaw nt nkau j 12. When a numeral follows a noun the affix ni is not used, except if the numeral be qualified by ddram or taram. (about), when the affix may be used.\nExamples.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions. As an illustration, consider the verb ce ‘know’:\n\n(31) jan-ea\n\nni ea eotj ce\n\nmanaw m-a?

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows.

In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

My fieldwork was sup­ ported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Nos. 24-2938 and 26-2254) from the Japan Society for the Promotion o f Science (JSPS).\n2 Example sentences are mostly taken from Jinghpaw Readers and the Jinghpaw Bible, which provide a rich exemplification of verbal endings lost in modem spoken Jingh­ paw (see section 5.4.1.6).\n3 Because o f the complex conditions and allomorphy, personal indices are treated as portmanteau with morphemes marking direction, intensity, possessor agreement, and mood in most previous studies, including Hanson (1896), Dai and Xu (1992), and Dai (2012), which employ quite a large number of paradigms or lists to represent them, with the exception of DeLancey (1980, 2011).",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

[ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . .

A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion.

Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization).

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972).

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972).

The kinship prefix ?a- and causative prefix £3-, for example, can only be added to monosyllabic bases. There are some special kinds of affixes, including a meaningless prefix ?a- which is employed only to add phonological bulk to monosyllabic bases, e.g. say ~ ?a-say ‘blood,’ and a nominalizing prefix ma- ‘everything that,’ originating from a full verb ma? ‘be exhausted’ (Hanson 1896: 32), which co-occurs with reduplication, e.g. ija-ma-ija [live-NMLZ-live] ‘everything that exists.’ Observe in the following examples that Jinghpaw has both class-maintaining (a, b, c) and class-changing affixes (d, e, f), and that only nouns and verbs are involved in affixation.\n\n(1) a. £3-na [cAus-hear] ‘inform’\n\nb.rt-la [NEG-take]\n\n‘not take’\n\nc. ?3-nu [KiN-motherJ ‘my mother’ d. ?a-tsom [ADV-beautiful] ‘well’\n\ne. ?3-£a [HAB-eat] ‘always eat’ f. cd-si [NMLZ-die]\n\n‘dead person’\n\nCompounding is a productive morphological process o f word formation.

Jinghpaw has a rich lexicon o f appositional compounds (f, g, h). They have a fixed order, and the order o f the members is largely predictable. Two major rules deter­ mine the ordering: higher first rule (Dai and Xu 1992: 400-5)— if the syllable length of the two members is equal, then the member including the higher vowel comes first (f, g); shorter first rule— if the syllable length o f the two members is not equal, then the shorter member comes first (h).\n\n(2) a. £3ta-pan [moon-flower] ‘sunflower’ b.pyen-li [fly-boat]",

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Many nouns are formed from verbal roots by the aid of certain pre­ fixes, as abawng, a prisoner, from bawng to confine ; nsa breath, from so. to breathe ; makham, a trap, from kharn to trap, &c.\n7. Compound nouns are formed by uniting nouns as shanhpi, leather, from shdn a common term for wild animals and hpi the skin, and by other combinations which are self-explanatory, as dut aiwa, the seller, from dut ai to sell and wa a person, &c.\n8. Monosyllabic nouns are frequently prefixed by a. Example : ja dja, gold ; na, dna, elder sister.\n(zz) When terms of relationship are prefixed by ning or n, their re­ lation to a second person is indicated. Example : hpu, elder brother; mighpu or nhpu, the elder brother of the person spoken to.\n(£) When prefixed by ka, their relation to a third person is indicat­ ed. Example : nau, younger brother ; kanau, the younger brother of the person spoken of.\nThe prefix kd is occasionally used in place of ning or n. It is, strictly speaking, incorrect to do so and its use in this manner should be avoided.\n(c) The prefixes ning, n and kd are used only with monosyllabic terms of relationship.\nForming the Plural.\n9. A general plural is most commonly formed by adding wz’tothe noun. Example : ma a child, ma ni children ; kumra a pony, kumra ni ponies.\n10. The plural is implied when nouns are followed by adjectives like all, some, many, and the numerals and the plural sign ni can be omitted.\nExamples.\nGwiyawngwau ai = All dogs (literally ‘dog’) bark. Nlong nkau grai ja ai = Some stones are very hard. Sdnat khun=Twenty guns. 11. The plural affix ni may, however, be used with adjectives that imply the plural.\nExamples.\nChingpaw nkau ) =Sorae men. Chingpaw nt nkau j 12. When a numeral follows a noun the affix ni is not used, except if the numeral be qualified by ddram or taram. (about), when the affix may be used.\nExamples.",

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

The addition of hie or hteng {see Pronouns) to the dual pronouns makes the number in the plural three or more.\nExamples.\nAn, we two ; Anhte, we (three or more). Nan, you two\\ Nanhte, you (three or more). Shan, they two ; Shanhte (three or more).\nGender.\n16. The masculine or feminine gender of individuals of the human fami­ ly is distinguished by different words, such as—\nSabrang = A lad, a young unmarried man, Makhavon = A maid, a young unmarried woman, Tingla = An old man, Kumgai ■ An old woman, Sinkra — A widower, Kaita or Kaina = A widow, and by most of the terms of relationship.\n17. The gender is also distinguished by placing la or lasha. for the male and num or numsha for the female before words of common gender.\nShadang and shayi for male and female are used likewise. Kdsha = A child. La kdsha = K male child. Num kdsha = A female child. Shadang sha = K son. Shayi sha = K daughter.\n17 (a). A lusty young man is sometimes called a gwila. There is no feminine term corresponding to gwila.\n18. But in the case of proper nouns of common gender the words la and num denoting the gender follow the noun as a rule.\nExamples.\nMyen la = A. Burman. Myen num=h Burmese woman.\n10. Wa for the masculine andjan for the feminine which are as often used as la and num always follow nouns of common gender.\nExamples.\nKdnau = Meaning a younger brother or sister. Kanau w« = Younger brother. Kanau jan = Younger sister. Muwa wa = Chinaman. Muvoa jan = Chinese woman.\n\n\f( 7 )\n\n20. The gender of the inferior animals is distinguished by affixing to the noun la for males and yi for females.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd?

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted.

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type.

These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Related to this is the reduplication-like noun-verb construction which may involve loanwords, such as damyaP mya? ‘rob’ (< Burmese damya ‘robber’) and lawban ban ‘become a boss’ (< Chinese laoban ‘boss’).

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

In the high level tone some laryngealized vowels alternate with nonlaryngealized variants. For example, [ka55] alternates with [ka55] as earth, place. Lexical contrasts among these rhymes are illustrated in Table 24.4.\n1.3 Tones\nThere are four tones altogether. Tone 1 is marked as a high level tone, e.g. [mu55] ‘work’, [kW55wa55] ‘bamboo’, but only in laryngealized syllables is it actually pronounced as a high level tone ([pai55] left (as opposed to right)); in non-laryngealized syllables it is pronounced as a mid-to-high rising tone ([pai35] again). Tone 2 is a mid level tone: [mu33] ‘delicious’, [wa33] ‘tooth’. Tone 3 is a low falling tone: [mu31] ‘to see’, [wa31] ‘to return’. Tone 4 falls from a high pitch across the full pitch range to a low pitch: [nu51] ‘mother’ (term of direct address), [wa51] ‘father’ (term of direct address). All four tones occur in unchecked syllables, while checked syllables are either the high level tone or the low falling tone. The great preponderance of high-to-low falling tones occur as a result of sandhi. For example, the expression combining [n55] ‘not with’ [wa31] ‘to return’ is [n55 wa51] ‘not to return’.\n1.4 Syllable structure\nSeven types of syllable structures occur. Type 1 is V + T (vowel with tone): [aʔ31] [X]’s. Type 2 is V + V + T: [ai31] ‘very’. Type 3 is V + C + T (vowel plus consonant with tone): [aŋ31] appropriate. Type 4 is C + V + T: [na33] ‘ear’. Type 5 is C + V + V + T: [nai31] ‘taro’. Type 6 is C + V + C + T: [naŋ33] you (singular). Type 7, which involves syllabic nasals, is C + T: [n55] ‘not’.\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation",

Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33",

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted.

[ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person.

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit?

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

            {
                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

                "content": "5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person.

In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

                "content": "5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person.

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd?

Lexical contrasts among these rhymes are illustrated in Table 24.4.\n1.3 Tones\nThere are four tones altogether. Tone 1 is marked as a high level tone, e.g. [mu55] ‘work’, [kW55wa55] ‘bamboo’, but only in laryngealized syllables is it actually pronounced as a high level tone ([pai55] left (as opposed to right)); in non-laryngealized syllables it is pronounced as a mid-to-high rising tone ([pai35] again). Tone 2 is a mid level tone: [mu33] ‘delicious’, [wa33] ‘tooth’. Tone 3 is a low falling tone: [mu31] ‘to see’, [wa31] ‘to return’. Tone 4 falls from a high pitch across the full pitch range to a low pitch: [nu51] ‘mother’ (term of direct address), [wa51] ‘father’ (term of direct address). All four tones occur in unchecked syllables, while checked syllables are either the high level tone or the low falling tone. The great preponderance of high-to-low falling tones occur as a result of sandhi. For example, the expression combining [n55] ‘not with’ [wa31] ‘to return’ is [n55 wa51] ‘not to return’.\n1.4 Syllable structure\nSeven types of syllable structures occur. Type 1 is V + T (vowel with tone): [aʔ31] [X]’s. Type 2 is V + V + T: [ai31] ‘very’. Type 3 is V + C + T (vowel plus consonant with tone): [aŋ31] appropriate. Type 4 is C + V + T: [na33] ‘ear’. Type 5 is C + V + V + T: [nai31] ‘taro’. Type 6 is C + V + C + T: [naŋ33] you (singular). Type 7, which involves syllabic nasals, is C + T: [n55] ‘not’.\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation",

Monosyllables are always heavy, being headed either by phonetically long vowels or phonetically short vowels followed by coda consonants. A large number of disyllables take the form of the iambic or ‘sesquisyllabic’ structure (Matisoff 1973), consisting of a major (heavy) syllable preceded by a minor (light) syllable with reduced phonemic possibilities. The examples given in Table 53.3 illustrate the Jinghpaw word structures.\nThe major syllable allows up to two prenuclear consonants and one postnuclear con­ sonant, so that the maximal structure is C]C2vc3, plus a tone, c, may be any consonant in the inventory when c2 is not filled. Sonority must increase in the onset. Two sonorants /r/ and lyl may occur as c2 when the preceding consonant is a stop (bilabial, velar) or nasal (bilabial, alveolar), except for the combination of a nasal plus /r/. The optional coda con­ sonant (c3) can be /p, t, k, ?, m, n, q, w, y/, where /k/ is mostly restricted to loanwords, as the Proto-Tibeto-Burman (PTB) coda *k has developed into 111 in modem Jinghpaw (Benedict 1972: 14). The four diphthongs, ui, oi, ai, au, can be interpreted phonologically as a sequence o f a vowel plus a glide, i.e. /uy/, /oy/, /ay/, /aw/, based on the fact that they never occur in closed syllables. The vowel-coda combination (vc3) is basically free, except when v is a schwa or when c3 is a glide.",

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Tone 1 is marked as a high level tone, e.g. [mu55] ‘work’, [kW55wa55] ‘bamboo’, but only in laryngealized syllables is it actually pronounced as a high level tone ([pai55] left (as opposed to right)); in non-laryngealized syllables it is pronounced as a mid-to-high rising tone ([pai35] again). Tone 2 is a mid level tone: [mu33] ‘delicious’, [wa33] ‘tooth’. Tone 3 is a low falling tone: [mu31] ‘to see’, [wa31] ‘to return’. Tone 4 falls from a high pitch across the full pitch range to a low pitch: [nu51] ‘mother’ (term of direct address), [wa51] ‘father’ (term of direct address). All four tones occur in unchecked syllables, while checked syllables are either the high level tone or the low falling tone. The great preponderance of high-to-low falling tones occur as a result of sandhi. For example, the expression combining [n55] ‘not with’ [wa31] ‘to return’ is [n55 wa51] ‘not to return’.\n1.4 Syllable structure\nSeven types of syllable structures occur. Type 1 is V + T (vowel with tone): [aʔ31] [X]’s. Type 2 is V + V + T: [ai31] ‘very’. Type 3 is V + C + T (vowel plus consonant with tone): [aŋ31] appropriate. Type 4 is C + V + T: [na33] ‘ear’. Type 5 is C + V + V + T: [nai31] ‘taro’. Type 6 is C + V + C + T: [naŋ33] you (singular). Type 7, which involves syllabic nasals, is C + T: [n55] ‘not’.\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation",

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T",

This prefix distinguishes [tʃW31phai33] ‘to make (somebody) lift (something) up’ from [phai33] ‘to lift (something) up’, ‘tʃW31kh at31’ ‘to drop (something) from (kh at31) ‘(for something) to drop’, [ʃW31pa55] ‘to tire (somebody)’ from [pa55] ‘to be tired’, [ʃW31tʃe33] ‘to let (somebody) know’ from [tʃe33] ‘to know’ and [sW31tsam33] ‘to make (something) rot’, ‘decay’ from [tsam33] ‘to rot, decay’ and so on.\nA number of verbs are causativized with the prefix [a31-]: [k op31] ‘(for something) to shatter’ and [a31k op31] ‘to shatter (something)’. A few verbs distinguish the causative by suppletive alternation: [ oŋ33] ‘(for something) to be inside (something else)’ and [ oŋ55] ‘to place (something) inside (something else)’; [tʃuŋ31] ‘(for something) to be loaded with (something else)’ and [tʃun55] ‘to load (something) with (something else)’.\nThe syntactic causative construction simply places the verb [ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause’ after the non-causative verb: [sa33] ‘to go’ and [sa33 ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause to go’; [kW31lo33] ‘to do’ and [kW31lo33 ʃ W31ŋun55] ‘to cause to do’.\nVerbs can be reduplicated with the added meaning of ‘constantly, regularly’ or ‘slightly’.

For example, [khat55] expresses that the action is reciprocal: [kW31 um33] means ‘to help’ and [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’.

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural.

The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages.

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template.

Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person.

The venitive (cislocative) r- marks motion toward the deictic center and the andative (translocative) s- marks motion away from the deictic center, as exemplified by a minimal pair below (see DeLancey 1980, for further discussion).

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972).

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

For example, modem spoken Jinghpaw usually does not encode the person category on the verb. In this style, the 3rd person declarative mood marker Pay, which also marks verb citation and clausal nominalization, plays a versatile role, being used irrespective of\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1007\nperson o f an argument (see Kurabe 2012, for an exemplification of this style). Using the personal indices in the spoken language sounds unnatural, judged to be highly elevated style. The simplification o f verbal endings seems to be caused by language contact. As van Driem (2001: 394) puts it:\nThe use of a somewhat pidginised and grammatically simplified Kachin Jinghpaw throughout northern Burma as a lingua franca between various Kachin communities is a long-standing phenomenon, and the existence o f this pidgin clouds the original picture of the Jinghpaw languages, as many o f the dialects have been influenced by the morphologically simplified lingua franca.\nThe simplification o f the verbal ending is also reported in Jinghpaw spoken in China, especially in the variety spoken by younger speakers (Dai 2012), as well as in Singpho in Northeast India (Morey 2010).\n\n5.4.2 Verb serialization",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

My fieldwork was sup­ ported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Nos. 24-2938 and 26-2254) from the Japan Society for the Promotion o f Science (JSPS).\n2 Example sentences are mostly taken from Jinghpaw Readers and the Jinghpaw Bible, which provide a rich exemplification of verbal endings lost in modem spoken Jingh­ paw (see section 5.4.1.6).\n3 Because o f the complex conditions and allomorphy, personal indices are treated as portmanteau with morphemes marking direction, intensity, possessor agreement, and mood in most previous studies, including Hanson (1896), Dai and Xu (1992), and Dai (2012), which employ quite a large number of paradigms or lists to represent them, with the exception of DeLancey (1980, 2011).",

In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T",

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull",

Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural.

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Only proximal demonstratives may be used for anaphora or cataphora.",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33",

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

In the high level tone some laryngealized vowels alternate with nonlaryngealized variants. For example, [ka55] alternates with [ka55] as earth, place. Lexical contrasts among these rhymes are illustrated in Table 24.4.\n1.3 Tones\nThere are four tones altogether. Tone 1 is marked as a high level tone, e.g. [mu55] ‘work’, [kW55wa55] ‘bamboo’, but only in laryngealized syllables is it actually pronounced as a high level tone ([pai55] left (as opposed to right)); in non-laryngealized syllables it is pronounced as a mid-to-high rising tone ([pai35] again). Tone 2 is a mid level tone: [mu33] ‘delicious’, [wa33] ‘tooth’. Tone 3 is a low falling tone: [mu31] ‘to see’, [wa31] ‘to return’. Tone 4 falls from a high pitch across the full pitch range to a low pitch: [nu51] ‘mother’ (term of direct address), [wa51] ‘father’ (term of direct address). All four tones occur in unchecked syllables, while checked syllables are either the high level tone or the low falling tone. The great preponderance of high-to-low falling tones occur as a result of sandhi. For example, the expression combining [n55] ‘not with’ [wa31] ‘to return’ is [n55 wa51] ‘not to return’.\n1.4 Syllable structure\nSeven types of syllable structures occur. Type 1 is V + T (vowel with tone): [aʔ31] [X]’s. Type 2 is V + V + T: [ai31] ‘very’. Type 3 is V + C + T (vowel plus consonant with tone): [aŋ31] appropriate. Type 4 is C + V + T: [na33] ‘ear’. Type 5 is C + V + V + T: [nai31] ‘taro’. Type 6 is C + V + C + T: [naŋ33] you (singular). Type 7, which involves syllabic nasals, is C + T: [n55] ‘not’.\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation",

Monosyllables are always heavy, being headed either by phonetically long vowels or phonetically short vowels followed by coda consonants. A large number of disyllables take the form of the iambic or ‘sesquisyllabic’ structure (Matisoff 1973), consisting of a major (heavy) syllable preceded by a minor (light) syllable with reduced phonemic possibilities. The examples given in Table 53.3 illustrate the Jinghpaw word structures.\nThe major syllable allows up to two prenuclear consonants and one postnuclear con­ sonant, so that the maximal structure is C]C2vc3, plus a tone, c, may be any consonant in the inventory when c2 is not filled. Sonority must increase in the onset. Two sonorants /r/ and lyl may occur as c2 when the preceding consonant is a stop (bilabial, velar) or nasal (bilabial, alveolar), except for the combination of a nasal plus /r/. The optional coda con­ sonant (c3) can be /p, t, k, ?, m, n, q, w, y/, where /k/ is mostly restricted to loanwords, as the Proto-Tibeto-Burman (PTB) coda *k has developed into 111 in modem Jinghpaw (Benedict 1972: 14). The four diphthongs, ui, oi, ai, au, can be interpreted phonologically as a sequence o f a vowel plus a glide, i.e. /uy/, /oy/, /ay/, /aw/, based on the fact that they never occur in closed syllables. The vowel-coda combination (vc3) is basically free, except when v is a schwa or when c3 is a glide.",

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below.

In the high level tone some laryngealized vowels alternate with nonlaryngealized variants. For example, [ka55] alternates with [ka55] as earth, place. Lexical contrasts among these rhymes are illustrated in Table 24.4.\n1.3 Tones\nThere are four tones altogether. Tone 1 is marked as a high level tone, e.g. [mu55] ‘work’, [kW55wa55] ‘bamboo’, but only in laryngealized syllables is it actually pronounced as a high level tone ([pai55] left (as opposed to right)); in non-laryngealized syllables it is pronounced as a mid-to-high rising tone ([pai35] again). Tone 2 is a mid level tone: [mu33] ‘delicious’, [wa33] ‘tooth’. Tone 3 is a low falling tone: [mu31] ‘to see’, [wa31] ‘to return’. Tone 4 falls from a high pitch across the full pitch range to a low pitch: [nu51] ‘mother’ (term of direct address), [wa51] ‘father’ (term of direct address). All four tones occur in unchecked syllables, while checked syllables are either the high level tone or the low falling tone. The great preponderance of high-to-low falling tones occur as a result of sandhi. For example, the expression combining [n55] ‘not with’ [wa31] ‘to return’ is [n55 wa51] ‘not to return’.\n1.4 Syllable structure\nSeven types of syllable structures occur. Type 1 is V + T (vowel with tone): [aʔ31] [X]’s. Type 2 is V + V + T: [ai31] ‘very’. Type 3 is V + C + T (vowel plus consonant with tone): [aŋ31] appropriate. Type 4 is C + V + T: [na33] ‘ear’. Type 5 is C + V + V + T: [nai31] ‘taro’. Type 6 is C + V + C + T: [naŋ33] you (singular). Type 7, which involves syllabic nasals, is C + T: [n55] ‘not’.\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation",

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9.

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

Monosyllables are illustrated by [ŋai33] first person singular pronoun, [ʃat31] ‘food’, [sa33] ‘to go’, and [ph o31] ‘white’. Most polysyllabic words are disyllabic; these disyllabic monomorphemic words typically involve phenomena such as alliteration and rhyme reduplication, as in [koŋ31kaŋ31] ‘celery’ and [tʃiŋ31liŋ55] ‘spirit bird’.\nPolymorphemic words involve compounding in some cases and affixation in others. Four kinds of compounds occur. In the first kind the morphemes are coordinate: [phu31] ‘elder brother(s)’ and [nau33] ‘younger brother(s)’ are coordinate in [phu31nau33]; so are [lW31mu31] ‘heaven’ and [ka55] ‘earth’ [lW31mu31ka55] ‘in universe’; [kun33] ‘to carry’ and [phai33] ‘to lift’ or ‘raise’ in [kun33phai33] ‘to bear’ or ‘shoulder (a burden)’; [dip31] ‘to press’ and [sep31] ‘to peel’ in [dip31sep31] ‘to exploit’.\nIn the second kind of compound formation, one morpheme modifies the other. If the modifying element is nominal, it precedes the nominal head; if it is adjectival, it follows. For example nominal [sai31] ‘blood’ precedes [lam33] ‘road’, ‘path’ in [sai31lam33] ‘blood vessel’, and nominal [mjiʔ 31] ‘eye’ precedes [mun33] ‘body hair’ in [myiʔ 31mun33] ‘eyelashes’. Adjectival [tui31] ‘sweet’ follows [tʃum31] salt in [tʃum31tui31] ‘sugar’ and [tʃaŋ33] black follows [pjen33] ‘board’ in [pjen33tʃaŋ 33] ‘blackboard’. When verbal morphemes modify nominal ones, some precede the head but the majority follow. The modifying verbal morpheme [ŋam31] ‘to be left over’ follows the nominal head [ʃat31] ‘food’ in [ʃat31ŋam31] ‘leftover",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit?

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T",

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull",

My fieldwork was sup­ ported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Nos. 24-2938 and 26-2254) from the Japan Society for the Promotion o f Science (JSPS).\n2 Example sentences are mostly taken from Jinghpaw Readers and the Jinghpaw Bible, which provide a rich exemplification of verbal endings lost in modem spoken Jingh­ paw (see section 5.4.1.6).\n3 Because o f the complex conditions and allomorphy, personal indices are treated as portmanteau with morphemes marking direction, intensity, possessor agreement, and mood in most previous studies, including Hanson (1896), Dai and Xu (1992), and Dai (2012), which employ quite a large number of paradigms or lists to represent them, with the exception of DeLancey (1980, 2011).",

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd?

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972).

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted.

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template. Observe in the example that the verb agrees in number and person with a pos­ sessor argument, the agreement o f which is signaled by the possessor agreement marker /- ‘pa’ as well as that the cross-referencing is not always with core arguments.\n\nnanthe ?a? myit-masin\n\n2pl\n\nGEN mind-liver\n\nphrii7 mat ma-sa-l-it\n\nfull",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person.

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9.

As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37).

Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33",

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

Demonstratives and personal pronouns, for example, only allow post-adnominals. Table 53.4 summarizes the properties of noun sub­ classes in terms of whether a given noun: (a) can be the head of an np; (b) can occur on its own; (c) can be pluralized by the plural marker; (d) can be quantified by a numeral; (e) can be determinated by a pre-head demonstrative; (f) can be preceded by a relative clause; (g) can be preceded by a genitive phrase; (h) can be determinated by a post-head demonstra­ tive; (i) can be modified by an adjective; or (j) can be involved in partial reduplication.\n\n5.2.1 Demonstratives\nJinghpaw demonstratives are distinguished in terms of speaker/addressee orientation, rel­ ative distance, and height from the speaker: nday [proximal; speaker-centered]; day [proximal; addressee-centered]; wd-ra [distal; level]; tho-ra [distal; up]; le-ra [distal; down], the latter three of which involve eara ‘place.’Demonstratives may occur in pre- or post-head positions, except when they modify locator nouns or postpositions, in which case only pre-head position is grammatical. Only proximal demonstratives may be used for anaphora or cataphora.",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

Although it superficially resembles morphological reduplica­ tion, this construction is beyond the scope of morphology, as can be seen in the fact that fully syntactic elements, such as adverbs, can be interposed.\n\n(3) a. maci?~ci?\n\n[sick-REDUP] ‘often sick’ b. masum-sum [three-REDUP]\n\n‘three each’\n\nc. laydy-yay\n\n[one-REDUP] ‘some’\n\nd. gaday~day [who-REDUP]\n\n‘who (pi.)’\n\ne. jakhriy~khrly [delay-REDUp] ‘often’\n\nf. thu?~thit?

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d?

A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun.

It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur.

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion.

For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used.

And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship.

The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33",

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

My fieldwork was sup­ ported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Nos. 24-2938 and 26-2254) from the Japan Society for the Promotion o f Science (JSPS).\n2 Example sentences are mostly taken from Jinghpaw Readers and the Jinghpaw Bible, which provide a rich exemplification of verbal endings lost in modem spoken Jingh­ paw (see section 5.4.1.6).\n3 Because o f the complex conditions and allomorphy, personal indices are treated as portmanteau with morphemes marking direction, intensity, possessor agreement, and mood in most previous studies, including Hanson (1896), Dai and Xu (1992), and Dai (2012), which employ quite a large number of paradigms or lists to represent them, with the exception of DeLancey (1980, 2011).",

He can consult the nats in five different ways:—\n\nFirst and originally with a small stone having a natural hole at one end, a string is tied to it and then let swing, the direction of its swinging determines the nat to whom offering is to be made as well as the offering; this method is now seldom in vogue, the one in more common use is—\nSecondly, the Jaba lap. it is a long leaf whose veins do not interlace so that it can be torn into long thin shreds ; these are then twisted together and cne ends tied at random. While doing this the Ningwawt wa speaks to the leaf, and asks it to indicate what nat must be appeased or in case that is determined, what offering is to be made ; this is done by untwisting the strings and seeing what strings are tied together and the kind of knot\ntied. Thirdly, the bamboo termed Saman. This bamboo is cut and stored\naway, when quite young, and can be found in every Kachin house ready for use. It is held over embers of fire until it bursts, when the splinters or, hairy fibres are examined to determine the desire of the nats or fore­ cast the future of the question in hand.\nFourthly, a piece of ginger is taken and cut into slices, then wrapped up into a leaf. The Ningwawt wa then talks to it and blows upon it, after which he holds it up to his ears and finally opens the parcel and reads its\ncontents. Fifthly, an egg is rolled up in a leaf and blown into; it is then held\nup to the ears, after which the egg is taken out of the leaf and placed upon the palm of the hand. The question in hand is determined by the eggs standing on an end on the palm of its own accord. These last two methods are but seldom resorted to and are therefore not in common use. The two most important methods and those recognized by all Kachins are\nthat by leaf and bamboo.",

The story in brief is as follows : —\n\n“ All men were immortal till they deceived the Lady Sun, a beneficent“ spirit who holds the strings {sumri} of life. She then ordered that all old “ (grey-haired) men die, but the chameleon {nat ?), who has always been “evilly disposed towards man, marred the words of the Lady Sun and caus“ ed death to visit old and young alike.\nThe analogy between this story and our account of the fall of our first parents is curious.\nRegarding the ceremonies that take place at death, Anderson says: “ When a Kakhyen (Kachin) dies, the news is announced\nFuneral ceremo- “ by the discharge of matchlocks. This is a signal for “ all to repair to the house of death. Some cut bamboos\n“and timber for the coffin, others prepare for the funeral rites. A circle of “bamboos is driven into the ground slanting outwards, so that the upper “ circle is much wider than the base. (This is termed karoii) To each a “ small flag is fastened ; grass is placed between this circle and the house, “ and the tumsa scatters grass over the bamboos and pours a libation of “ sheroo {i.e., Sharu or Chdru, Kachin spirit).\n“A hog is then slaughtered and the flesh cooked and distributed, the “ skull being fixed on one of the bamboos. The coffin is made of the hollow “trunk of a large tree which the men fell with their das. Just before it “falls a fowl is killed by being dashed against the tottering stem.”\nGeorge here remarks:— “ The object of this, as explained to me, is to induce the spirit of the “departed, by the sacrifice, to make the tree fall fairly so as to be easily “split to make the coffin, it being the custom to split the trunk, hollow the “inside for the coffin, and use the split pieces as coffin and lid, thereby\n“ ensuring that the junction of the two shall be even.”\nAfter this the face is washed and the body dressed in new clothes. “ A\n“ piece of silver is inserted in the .mouth to pay ferry dues over the stream\n\n\f( 144 )",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural.

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.",

In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’.

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T",

Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted.

For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’.

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted.

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration.

Recall that in the latter case, plural number is marked by ma- regardless o f person (section 5.4.1.1). Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33",

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",
