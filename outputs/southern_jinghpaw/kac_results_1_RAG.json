We briefly point out below some special characteristics.\nPersonal pronouns distinguish three values for number: singular, dual, and plural; these values are marked by internal alternation and the plural suffix [-the33]. They are given in Table 24.5.\nThe singular personal pronouns have special possessive forms: [ŋjeʔ 55] ‘my’, [naʔ 55] ‘your’, [khjiʔ 55] and [ʃiʔ 55] ‘his’, ‘her’.\nAmong verbs, causatives are distinguished from non-causatives; this distinction can be marked with morphological prefixes or a syntactic construction involving a causative verb.",

                "content": "5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37).

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below.

This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Jinghpaw numerals from 3 to 100, including a distinct root khun ‘20’ (cf. Written Burmese akun ‘all’), are inherited from PTB. The usual numerals larjay ‘one’ and lakhor/ ‘two’ are Jinghpaw innovations, although more general TB roots for ‘one’ and ‘two’ also survive in certain environments, e.g. maray mi [cLF:HUMAN-one] ‘one person’ and ni-nd? [two-night] ‘two nights’ (Matisoff 1994). An interrogative gade ‘how many/much’can be shown to be a numeral on the grounds that it shows the same distribution as other numer­ als. It is of interest to note that round numbers such as khyitj ‘1,000,’ mim ‘10,000,’ sen ‘100,000,’ wan ‘1,000,000,’ and ri ‘10,000,000,’ all o f which are o f Shan or Chinese ori­ gin, are distinguished from inherited round numbers ei ‘ten’ and tsa ‘100’ in terms of the relative position in which they occur. Compare: mali-ei ‘40,’ mali-tsa ‘400,’ khyiij mali ‘4,000,’ mim mali ‘40,000,’ sen mali ‘400,000,’ etc. These borrowed round numbers can be interpreted as classifiers based on their position. This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals. The classifier numeral phrase can occur without a head noun. Consider:\n\n(6) a. ma masum child three ‘three children’\n\nb. ma maray child clf:human ‘three children’\n\nmasum three\n\nc. maray\n\nmasum\n\nclf:human three\n\n‘three persons’\n\nd. nday maray\n\nmasum\n\nthis clf:human three\n\n‘these three persons’",

                "content": "5.2.6 Postpositions\nJinghpaw has a small set of postpositions which function like case markers, such as dzdn ‘like,’ matu ‘for,’ maldy ‘instead,’ majd ‘because.’ The nounhood o f these postpositions can be seen from the fact that they can be modified by a genitive modifier unlike case markers, e.g. nd? matu [your-for] ‘for you,’ net? maldy [your-instead] ‘instead of you,’nd? majd [your-because] ‘because of you,’ etc.\n\n5.3 Case markers\n\nJinghpaw is a double-marking language at the clausal level and in general dependent­ marking at the np level. The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below. In possessive phrases, the possessor is basically marked by a genitive.\n\n(7) nye?\n\n?wd yay phe? tso?-ra? rjfj-ay.\n\nlsg.GEN father ls g acc love-like lsg-DECL\n\n‘My father loves me.’\n\n(8) natj phe? tjay japhu jo? na rjij-ay. 2sg acc lsg price give irr lsg-DECL ‘I will give you wages.’\n\nThe inventory o f Jinghpaw case markers is provided in Table 53.6. Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw.

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Notice also that the forms o f Sets la and lb are nearly identical except the syncretism of 1st person singular and 3rd person in Set lb, where the former patterns after the latter, and the 3rd person of Set la which displays two forms, where 0 - is used to mark a 3rd person singular in declarative mood with the direction slot unfilled and -a? elsewhere.\nThe choice between Set I and Set II is determined according to mood types or existence/ non-existence of morphemes in the direction slot, regardless o f aspect or verb types. This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9. (Note that phonemes -y- and -a- are inserted by epenthesis. As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs.

The template for verbal endings is given below. Person, number, aspect, and mood are obligatory categories in verbal endings. Optional morphemes marking direction, intensity, or possessor agreement, represented by direction in the template below, may intervene between the inflectional categories.\n\n(9) Verb-Number-Aspect-(Direction)-Person-Mood\n\nAs an illustration, consider the following sentence, which illustrates all categories in the template.

Argument indexation itself is achieved by number and personal indices affixed to and the function of /- is simply to signal that the agreement is with a possessor. The same slot may be occupied by n- ‘intns,’ the nature o f which is not fully understood although it expresses intensity in imperative and hortative moods.\nAs pointed out by DeLancey (1980, 2011) and Dai (2012), the morphemes occupying the direction slot have their sources in auxiliary verbs, which ultimately originate from full verbs, having been reduced both phonologically and semantically. Dai (2012:212-13) proposes that the marker /- ‘pa’ originates from a Jinghpaw verb lit ‘have, possess.’ DeLancey (1980: 165, 2011: 72) proposes that directional morphemes r- ‘ven’ and s‘a n d ’ are from verbs denoting ‘come’ and ‘go.’ DeLancey (2011: 64) suggests that the morpheme n- ‘intns’ probably reflects an old copula.\n\n5.4.1.4 Person\nPerson marking is the most complicated category in the verbal ending due to the fact that the personal indices display allomorphy, and that person indexation is based on a mixture o f systems drawing on grammatical roles as well as on a person hierarchy where speech act participants (SAPs) outrank a 3rd person. Person marking on verbs is achieved by means of affixation o f personal indices which consist o f four sets, as summarized in Table 53.7 (tones are not indicated).\n\n\f1004 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE S3.7 PERSONAL INDICES\n\nSet la\n\nSet lb\n\nSet II\n\nlsg\n\n-m -\n\n-a?\n\n-i?\n\nlpl\n\nga?-\n\nga?-\n\n-i?\n\n2nd\n\n-ind-\n\n-ind-\n\n-ild-\n\n3rd\n\n0-/-O?\n\n-a?\n\n-It?\n\nSet III\n-e? -e? dW-/0-",

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37).

This can be roughly summarized as given in Table 53.8. Set III indices are used to explicitly mark two participants (see below).\nAs an illustration, consider the paradigms of sa ‘go/come’ and ray ‘cop’ in declarative (marked by ay) or interrogative (marked by nT) mood in Table 53.9.

As for allomorphy conditions, see below.)\nAs can be seen, the most complex personal indices which take the phonological shape vc,c2 are realized by various allomorphs. The allomorphy conditions can be schematized as follows: vc,c2 -» vc,/ c _ c; vc,c2 —>c,c2/ #_v; vc,c2 —» c ,/#_ c. As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d?

In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

Through a process of phonological change this kind of word has come to synthesize and embody such grammatical meanings of the sentential predicate as mood, subject person and number, direction, and aspect. Mood has six values: declarative, interrogative, imperative, consultative, inferential and inexpectative. The imperative and consultative moods each subdivide into ordinary vs emphatic manners of speaking. The declarative, interrogative, inferential and inexpectative moods each subdivide on the basis of speaker attitude and intent into two subcategories: static and dynamic. Person has three values: first person, second person, and third person. Number has two values: singular and plural. Since the sentence-final word can reflect person and number, one can determine subject person and number even when the subject constituent is omitted. We display a subset of the declarative SFWs in Table 24.6. These SFWs displayed are illustrated in the following sentences.\n\n(6) ŋai33 ko31 tʃoŋ31ma31 ai55 ŋ31ŋai33",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person.

Serial verbs are contiguous, and the syntactic and semantic relationship holding between serialized verbs may be sequential, manner, purpose, or complementation. One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type. This behavioral property provides a piece of evidence to posit the category o f ‘subject’ in Jinghpaw. Sharing o f p is not obligatory.\n\n(27) tjay kha?-thui] de? htsin sa ja? lit? nthom .. 1sg water-tub all water go draw drink after ‘After 1went to the well and drew water and drank it.\n\n(28) ei com gd nam-mali\n\nde? lagyim sa mat hnd. . .\n\n3sg top top forest-forest all conceal go COMPL SEQ\n\n‘He withdrew to the forest and. . .’\n\n(29) la lakhotj go tsan Pay gd de? jum mari sa m-a?

The fact that they, in serialization, can be negated by the negative prefix suggests that they are genuine verbs. These auxiliary-like verbs include ce ‘know, be able to, be in the habit of,’ lit ‘get, can,’ may ‘be good, may,’ ma? ‘exhausted, entirely,’ and kam ‘be willing.’ Many of these verbs are special in that they can occur both in pre- and post-head positions.

As an illustration, consider the index And- ‘2nd’ in Table 53.10 which can be realized as the following four allomorphs in non-change of state aspect depending on the allomorphy conditions given above. As can be seen, from the underlying VC]C2 complex, c2 is deleted when followed by a consonant, and v is deleted when there are no preceding syllables, in which case the underlying low tone on the vowel is associated with the following coda nasal which is realized as a syllabic nasal in surface representation.3",

My fieldwork was sup­ ported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (Nos. 24-2938 and 26-2254) from the Japan Society for the Promotion o f Science (JSPS).\n2 Example sentences are mostly taken from Jinghpaw Readers and the Jinghpaw Bible, which provide a rich exemplification of verbal endings lost in modem spoken Jingh­ paw (see section 5.4.1.6).\n3 Because o f the complex conditions and allomorphy, personal indices are treated as portmanteau with morphemes marking direction, intensity, possessor agreement, and mood in most previous studies, including Hanson (1896), Dai and Xu (1992), and Dai (2012), which employ quite a large number of paradigms or lists to represent them, with the exception of DeLancey (1980, 2011).",

In [jam33ŋa33] ‘slave’, however, verbal [jam33] ‘to keep in bondage’ precedes [ŋa33] ‘livestock animal’, and in [pjen33li33] ‘aeroplane’ [pjen33] ‘to fly’ precedes [li33] ‘boat’.\nThe third kind of compound formation involves the object-verb relationship. In [tsi31kut31] ‘double-edged fine-tooth comb’ [tsi31] ‘lice’ is the object of [kut31] ‘to get rid of’; in [man33ju33] ‘mirror’ [man33] ‘face’ is the object of the verb [ju33] ‘to look at’.\nThe fourth kind of composition involves the subject–predicate relationship. In [mjit31kh um55] ‘to be united’, [mjit31] ‘thought’ is the subject of the predicate [kh um55] ‘to meet up with’; in [ka31loʔ 55] ‘to quarrel’, [ka31] ‘speech’, ‘talk’ is the subject of the predicate [loʔ 55] ‘to be much’.\nPolymorphemic words formed by affixation involve prefixation, infixation, or suffixation, with prefixation predominating. The derivational prefix [tʃW-] attaches to a monosyllabic adjectival morpheme to form a noun. For example, [tʃW-] prefixed to [khat55] ‘(food) burnt’ derives [tʃW55khat55] ‘substance that has been cooked to burning’; prefixed to [kh i33] ‘sour it’ derives [tʃW33kh i33] ‘sour substance’. The prefix [mW-] derives nouns from verbal and adjectival monosyllables. For example, with verbal [tin31] ‘to separate’, ‘partition’ it derives [mW31tin31] ‘partition board’; ‘diaphragm’; with [kh i33] ‘sour’ it derives [mW33kh i33] ‘sour bamboo shoot’.\nThe infix [-mW-] or [-mi-] occurs between two instances of verbal or adjectival monosyllables to derive a noun meaning all that which . . . or all those who . . . . For example, with [ŋa31] ‘to be (at a place)’ it forms [ŋa31mW55ŋa51] ‘all who are present’, ‘all those present’; with [laŋ33] ‘to use’ it forms [laŋ33mW33laŋ 33] ‘everything being used’ or ‘everything of use’.",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below.

Note that the 2nd person prefix h- apparently came from nay ‘you’ or\n\nTABLE 53.4 PROPERTIES OF NOUN SUBCLASSES\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\n(d) 00 (f) (g) (h) (0 (i)\n\ncommon nouns\n\nyes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes some\n\nnumerals\n\nyes yes yes no yes yes yes yes no yes\n\ndemonstratives\n\nyes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\npersonal pronouns\n\nyes yes some yes no no no no no no\n\ninterrogative pronouns yes yes yes yes no no no no no yes\n\nlocator nouns\n\nyes yes no\n\nno yes yes yes no no no\n\npostpositions\n\nyes no no\n\nno yes yes yes no no some\n\n\f1000 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.5 PERSONAL PRONOUNS\n\nSingular ( n o m )\n\nSingular ( g e n )\n\n1st\n\nnay\n\n2nd\n\nnag\n\n3rd\n\nei\n\nnye? na? ei?\n\nDual\nPan nan ean\n\nPlural\n?anlhe nanthe eanthe\n\nna? ‘your.’ Less apparent, the 3rd person prefix ga- seems to have a historical connection to the 3rd person pronoun which is pronounced khyi in some Jinghpaw varieties (Dai and Xu 1992: 23), suggesting a sound change *khyi > ei in Standard Jinghpaw.\n\n(5) a. nye? ?a-phu ‘my brother’\n\nb. ?anthe ?a? ?a-phu ‘our brother’\n\nc.n a ? h -p h u ‘your (sg) brother’ d. nanthe ?a? n-phu ‘your (pi) brother’",

The common plural sign ni may or may not be used with them.\nExamples.\nWora laguyan myit rau ai = Both those thieves are of one mind. Shan ma ni kahsup nga ai = Those two children are playing. 15. The addition of hie or hteng {see Pronouns) to the dual pronouns makes the number in the plural three or more.\nExamples.\nAn, we two ; Anhte, we (three or more). Nan, you two\\ Nanhte, you (three or more). Shan, they two ; Shanhte (three or more).\nGender.\n16. The masculine or feminine gender of individuals of the human fami­ ly is distinguished by different words, such as—\nSabrang = A lad, a young unmarried man, Makhavon = A maid, a young unmarried woman, Tingla = An old man, Kumgai ■ An old woman, Sinkra — A widower, Kaita or Kaina = A widow, and by most of the terms of relationship.\n17. The gender is also distinguished by placing la or lasha. for the male and num or numsha for the female before words of common gender.\nShadang and shayi for male and female are used likewise. Kdsha = A child. La kdsha = K male child. Num kdsha = A female child. Shadang sha = K son. Shayi sha = K daughter.\n17 (a). A lusty young man is sometimes called a gwila. There is no feminine term corresponding to gwila.\n18. But in the case of proper nouns of common gender the words la and num denoting the gender follow the noun as a rule.\nExamples.\nMyen la = A. Burman. Myen num=h Burmese woman.\n10. Wa for the masculine andjan for the feminine which are as often used as la and num always follow nouns of common gender.\nExamples.\nKdnau = Meaning a younger brother or sister. Kanau w« = Younger brother. Kanau jan = Younger sister. Muwa wa = Chinaman. Muvoa jan = Chinese woman.\n\n\f( 7 )\n\n20.

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T",

Nouns are defined by their ability to be the heads of nps. Verbs are words which share a bundle of properties, such as the ability to be negated by the negative prefix and the ability to inflect for person, number, aspect, and mood. As such, verbs denoting property concepts, including adjectives, form a subclass of verbs. Particles are words which cannot form utterances on their own, and interjections are words which do not hold any syntactic relationship with other words. Adverbs do not have any of the properties given above, typically occurring in immediate pre-verbal posi­ tion. Many Jinghpaw adverbs are of verbal origin, both synchronically and diachronically, being or having been derived from lexical verbs by means o f affixation, reduplication, and adverbialization o f serial verbs.\n\n5.2 The noun phrase",

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Interrogative pronouns include: pha ‘what,’ ga-day [ga-that] ‘who,’ and ga-ra [ga-place] ‘where, which.’The interrogative ga-day ‘who’ has a distinctive genitive form ga-de) ‘whose,’ which results from a contraction of ga-day plus ?a? ‘gen.’ Interrogative\n\n\fJINGHPAW 1001\npronouns, together with interrogative adverbs such as ga-loy [ga-then] ‘when,’ ga-naij [ga-here] ‘where,’ga-de? [ga-ALL] ‘to where,’ga-wi?; [ga-thus] ‘how,’ form interrogative pro-forms. These interrogative pro-forms all trigger the occurrence of the mood marker for wh-questions, thereby constituting a natural class. Moreover, they can form question sentences on their own, unlike other nouns or adverbs. Jinghpaw also frequently uses lexicalized expressions involving interrogatives as their elements, e.g. pha bd? [whatkind] ‘what,’ pha majo [what-because] ‘why,’ ga-ra khu [which-like] ‘how,’ ga-ra ten [which-time] ‘what time.’\n\n5.2.5 Locator nouns\nJinghpaw has a set of locator nouns which specify spatio-temporal relations o f argu­ ments, including eoij ‘before,'phay ‘behind,’ htsa ‘above,’ and hpu? ‘below.’ Some loca­ tor nouns express abstract meanings, as exemplified by htsa ‘above,’ which also carries the sense o f ‘regarding to,’ and phatj ‘behind,’ which occurs obligatorily when animate nouns stand as the goal of movement marked by the allative de?.",

In the high level tone some laryngealized vowels alternate with nonlaryngealized variants. For example, [ka55] alternates with [ka55] as earth, place. Lexical contrasts among these rhymes are illustrated in Table 24.4.\n1.3 Tones\nThere are four tones altogether. Tone 1 is marked as a high level tone, e.g. [mu55] ‘work’, [kW55wa55] ‘bamboo’, but only in laryngealized syllables is it actually pronounced as a high level tone ([pai55] left (as opposed to right)); in non-laryngealized syllables it is pronounced as a mid-to-high rising tone ([pai35] again). Tone 2 is a mid level tone: [mu33] ‘delicious’, [wa33] ‘tooth’. Tone 3 is a low falling tone: [mu31] ‘to see’, [wa31] ‘to return’. Tone 4 falls from a high pitch across the full pitch range to a low pitch: [nu51] ‘mother’ (term of direct address), [wa51] ‘father’ (term of direct address). All four tones occur in unchecked syllables, while checked syllables are either the high level tone or the low falling tone. The great preponderance of high-to-low falling tones occur as a result of sandhi. For example, the expression combining [n55] ‘not with’ [wa31] ‘to return’ is [n55 wa51] ‘not to return’.\n1.4 Syllable structure\nSeven types of syllable structures occur. Type 1 is V + T (vowel with tone): [aʔ31] [X]’s. Type 2 is V + V + T: [ai31] ‘very’. Type 3 is V + C + T (vowel plus consonant with tone): [aŋ31] appropriate. Type 4 is C + V + T: [na33] ‘ear’. Type 5 is C + V + V + T: [nai31] ‘taro’. Type 6 is C + V + C + T: [naŋ33] you (singular). Type 7, which involves syllabic nasals, is C + T: [n55] ‘not’.\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation",

A few verbs distinguish the causative by suppletive alternation: [ oŋ33] ‘(for something) to be inside (something else)’ and [ oŋ55] ‘to place (something) inside (something else)’; [tʃuŋ31] ‘(for something) to be loaded with (something else)’ and [tʃun55] ‘to load (something) with (something else)’.\nThe syntactic causative construction simply places the verb [ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause’ after the non-causative verb: [sa33] ‘to go’ and [sa33 ʃW31ŋun55] ‘to cause to go’; [kW31lo33] ‘to do’ and [kW31lo33 ʃ W31ŋun55] ‘to cause to do’.\nVerbs can be reduplicated with the added meaning of ‘constantly, regularly’ or ‘slightly’.

Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

The case marking pattern is the nominative-accusative type (s/a vs. p), in which s and a occur without any overt marker, in contrast to p which, in a tran­ sitive clause, is marked by an accusative marker when there is a possibility that it may be misconstrued with a, displaying the ‘anti-ergative’ marking (LaPolla 1992), as illustrated below.

Case markers, aside from the two genitive cases, occur at the clausal level. Genitive, ablative, and comitative cases can occur at the np level. The locative tha? and perlative khu are of nominal origin, coming from latha? ‘upper’ and khu ‘hole.’ The ablative hna, which is also used as a sequential subordinator and often pronounced nd in colloquial speech, usually co-occurs with a preceding locative case. The genitive nd, which seems to have been derived from the ablative hna, marks a possessive relationship when the possessor noun is a location or time.\n\n\f1002 TIBETO-BURMAN: OTHER LANGUAGES\n\nTABLE 53.6 CASE MARKERS\n\nphe? accusative P(patient, recipient, causee, applied object); path\n\nled? locative",

Nominalized clauses are formed chiefly by Pay, which also marks verb citations and declarative mood. A nominalized clause plays a versatile role, func­ tioning as a complement clause (verbal or nominal), as in (33), relative clause (headed or headless), as in (34), (35), adverbial clause, as in (36), or non-embedded, independent clause followed by a copula, as in (37). This kind o f special relationship between nomi­ nalization and subordination is a widespread phenomenon within TB languages (Matisoff 1972). Consider the following Jinghpaw examples (square brackets are used to enclose nominalized clauses):\n\n(33) khaP eadon yu yarj [hlam khun siuj Pay] ce m-d?

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

In the high level tone some laryngealized vowels alternate with nonlaryngealized variants. For example, [ka55] alternates with [ka55] as earth, place. Lexical contrasts among these rhymes are illustrated in Table 24.4.\n1.3 Tones\nThere are four tones altogether. Tone 1 is marked as a high level tone, e.g. [mu55] ‘work’, [kW55wa55] ‘bamboo’, but only in laryngealized syllables is it actually pronounced as a high level tone ([pai55] left (as opposed to right)); in non-laryngealized syllables it is pronounced as a mid-to-high rising tone ([pai35] again). Tone 2 is a mid level tone: [mu33] ‘delicious’, [wa33] ‘tooth’. Tone 3 is a low falling tone: [mu31] ‘to see’, [wa31] ‘to return’. Tone 4 falls from a high pitch across the full pitch range to a low pitch: [nu51] ‘mother’ (term of direct address), [wa51] ‘father’ (term of direct address). All four tones occur in unchecked syllables, while checked syllables are either the high level tone or the low falling tone. The great preponderance of high-to-low falling tones occur as a result of sandhi. For example, the expression combining [n55] ‘not with’ [wa31] ‘to return’ is [n55 wa51] ‘not to return’.\n1.4 Syllable structure\nSeven types of syllable structures occur. Type 1 is V + T (vowel with tone): [aʔ31] [X]’s. Type 2 is V + V + T: [ai31] ‘very’. Type 3 is V + C + T (vowel plus consonant with tone): [aŋ31] appropriate. Type 4 is C + V + T: [na33] ‘ear’. Type 5 is C + V + V + T: [nai31] ‘taro’. Type 6 is C + V + C + T: [naŋ33] you (singular). Type 7, which involves syllabic nasals, is C + T: [n55] ‘not’.\n2 GRAMMAR\n2.1 Word formation",

Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position.

A demonstrative may occur in either pre- or post-head position, e.g. nday manay [this-friend] ~ manay nday. Note that, although verbs denoting property concepts may occur after nouns, e.g. pii-khd [intestine-bitter] ‘gallbladder,’ many of them cannot occur in this position freely, e.g. *ndms\\-kha [fruit-bitter]. This fact suggests that these examples are compounds, not syntactic phrases. Most verbs, including verbs expressing property concepts, syntactically modify nouns only by means o f relativization (nominalization). There is, nevertheless, a small set of verbs which freely modify nouns in post-nominal position. These verbs express the four core semantic types of adjectives (Dixon 1977), i.e. dimension, age, value, and color, such as gaba ‘big,’ diysa ‘old gaja ‘good,’ andphrd ‘white.’This chapter treats only these words as ‘adjectives,’ which are a subclass of verbs.\n\n(4) a. nye? manay my friend ‘my friend’\n\nb. eat ea Pay food eat nmlz ‘friend who ate food’\n\nmanay friend\n\n\fJINGHPAW 999\n\nc. manat] gaja friend good ‘good friend’\n\nd. gaja Pay good nmlz ‘good friend’\n\nmanay friend\n\ne. manat] gaja ni friend good pi ‘three good friends’\n\nmaray clf:human\n\nmasum three",

This is supported, in part, by the fact that Jinghpaw has borrowed many classifiers from neighboring languages (Xu 1987).\nJinghpaw is not a classifier-rich language. Numerals can occur in the absence of clas­ sifiers, and nouns can be directly quantified by numerals. There is, however, a small set of classifiers that can precede numerals.

One constraint imposed on Jinghpaw serial verbs is that a and/or s must be shared between serialized verbs with the exception o f the com­ plementation type.

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

There is no gender or inclusive/exclusive distinction. Separate genitive forms exist for singular, which are likely to have their diachronic sources in the contraction of singular personal pronouns and the genitive case marker PaP. Duals appear to involve the obsolete numeral ni ‘two’(Wolfenden 1929: 73). Plural pronouns are segmentable into duals plus an element the ‘all, whole.’\nRelated to this is the three-way distinction of possessive bound pronouns which are prefixed only to inalienable kinship terms, illustrated below. Although limited in scope, these pronominal possessive prefixes imposed on the possessum can be seen as instances of head-marking.

According to which mood they manifest, Jinghpaw verbal sentences can be divided into six types. Negated commands are formed by imperative mood with the adverb khiim, which originates from the verb khiim ‘prohibit.’ It is o f interest to note that commands can be directed at any person. Canonical imperatives directed at the addressee are formed by the imperative marker 0 , and non-canonical imperatives directed at the speaker or 3rd person are formed by the hortative marker gaP.\n\n(24) Pnatj de? sa\n\nr-it-0.\n\nhere ALL go/come VEN-2nd-iMP\n\n‘Come here.’\n\n(25) yaP go ijay bay tsun ij-ga?. now TOP 1sg again say 1sg-HORT\n‘Now let me tell you again.’ (Dai and Xu 1992: 296)\n\n(26) ei nanthe phatj\n\n3sg 2pl\n\nbehind\n\n‘Let him go to you.’\n\nde? sa all go/come\n\nPuP-gaP.\n3 rd-H O R T",

                "content": "verbs has developed from verbs, with the meaning of the verb being relatively vivid and concrete and that of the auxiliary more abstract. For example, the verb [mat31] means ‘to\ncome to be lost’; the auxiliary of the same form specifies conclusion of the action. Auxiliary\nverbs cannot be modified by adverbs. Like verbs, most auxiliaries can be reduplicated with the meaning of ‘constantly’, ‘regularly’: compare [kW31 um33 khat55] ‘to help each other’ and [kW31 um33 khat55khat55] ‘to help each other on a regular basis’.\nMeasure words are few. When what is measured or counted is the individual instance of\nwhat the noun represents, most nouns do not use measure words: the numeral applies directly to the noun. For example, the expression [mW31ʃa31 lW55ŋai51] ‘one person’ uses only the noun [mW31ʃa31] ‘person’ and the numeral [lW55ŋai51] ‘one’; [nam31si31 lW55khoŋ51] ‘two pieces of fruit’ uses only the noun [nam31si31] ‘fruit’ and the numeral [lW55khoŋ51] ‘two’. On\nthe other hand, when what is being counted or measured is in terms of extent, capacity,\nweight, collective units, and so on, then a measure word is used. For example, the phrase [tʃum31 oŋ31 mji33] a ‘liang (50 grams) of salt’ uses not only the noun [tʃum31] ‘salt’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [ oŋ31] ‘liang’. Likewise the expression [ŋa33 wW33noŋ33 mji33] ‘a herd of cattle’ uses not only the noun [ŋa33] ‘cow’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, a but also the measure word [wW33noŋ33] ‘herd (of some kind of animal)’. And [ʃat31 wan33 mji33] ‘a bowl of rice’ uses the measure word [wan33] ‘bowl (of something)’ together with the noun [ʃat31] ‘rice’, ‘food’ and the numeral [mji33] ‘one’, ‘a’.\nMost measure words come from nouns and verbs, with some being loans from other languages. When a measure word is applied to a verb, the common choice is [laŋ31] ‘time(s)’, which follows the numeral instead of preceding it: [lW55khoŋ51 laŋ31] ‘twice’,\n‘two times’.",

Verb agreement is with s in intransitive clauses, as in (14), and with a in polyvalent clauses when the participant-configurations are SAP —>SAP, SAP —>non-SAP, and non-SAP <-> non-SAP, as in examples (15) to (17). When the participant-configuration is non-SAP —►SAP, how­ ever, verb agreement is either with SAP or non-SAP, as in examples (18) and (19). The former agreement pattern here is that of hierarchical person marking (DeLancey 1980: 25-7), in which the person marking is determined by a person hierarchy SAP > 3rd, pre­ sumably because of the greater salience of SAPs. The situation thus leads to a conclusion that the coding property of verbal agreement cannot be used to define ‘subject’in Jinghpaw since s may align with both a and p in terms of person in the non-SAP -*• SAP configuration. For concreteness, consider the following examples:\n(14) yay go Pwa phay de? wa na rjy-ay. lsg top father behind all return irr lsg-DECL ‘I am going to the Father.’",
