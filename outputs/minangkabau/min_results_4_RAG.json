Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm of markers that have a clear spatial deictic function.

Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning ‘a certain’.

Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Jacobson, 1979; Swadesh, 1939), Salishan languages (cf. Jelinek and Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) and Polynesian languages (cf. Broschart, 1997; Mosel and Hovdhaugen, 1992) are said to lack a noun-verb distinction; therefore it cannot be said that the primitive features [±noun] and [±verb] are underlying in these languages. Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52",

            "summary": "GB024 focuses on the order of cardinal numerals (not ordinal numerals) and nouns in quantified noun phrases. This feature has also been split into two binary features, \"GB024a Is the order of the numeral and noun Num-N?\" and \"GB024b Is the order of the numeral and noun N-Num?\". It is possible to answer 1 or 0 for one of the binarised features, and \"?\" for the other.\n\nIn some languages only one order (Numeral-Noun or Noun-Numeral) is possible. In other languages, both orders may be possible. This can take the form of free variation (where Numeral-Noun and Noun-Numeral order can occur interchangeably). The order may also depend on some other grammatical category which is neutral with respect to pragmaticality (e.g. definiteness). If the order depends on the noun, consider only the orders that apply to an open class of nouns and disregard orders that are restricted to a specific closed class of nouns.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Consider only phrases with the meaning 'X (numeral) units of Y (noun)' in their pragmatically neutral form. It does not matter what kind of construction is required (e.g. attributive *two books* or relative *books that are two*) or what word class the root or modifying form of the cardinal numerals belongs to, e.g. *two-ing books* (verb) or *two-some books* (noun) apply to this question.\n2. If the numeral always precedes the noun, code 1 for GB024 or 1 for GB024a. \n3. If the numeral always follows the noun, code 2 for GB024 or 1 for GB024b\n4. If a closed class of nouns requires a different order than an open class, disregard the closed class and code the order that applies to the open class.\n5. If both orders occur for an open class of nouns, that is if some numerals precede and some follow, or there is a free choice or there is a choice depending on some other factor (e.g. definiteness), code 3 for GB024 or 1 for GB024a and GB024b.\n\n",

For example, in (61) the verb mancarito-carito, ‘tell a story’, has been derived from the NP carito, ‘story,’ (see Section 6.3.1.3 for more examples of active verbs derived from nominals).\n\n(61)\n\nE ado mancarito-carito jo ambo.\n\nFILL exist AV-RED-story\n\nwith 1sg\n\n‘Somebody told me the story.’\n\n(Text ID: 157057083427161106)\n\nUnmarked nominals can be predicative even when a marked alternative exists.

Firstly, paN- and its correspondences do not refer to the location where the action or event takes place. An exception to this is IBN paN- which, as the only nominalising affix in IBN, has generalised its meaning in a maximal way. Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT). Fourthly, the syntactical role of SM paN- and MIN paN- is quite different from the (more restricted) role of their correspondences in other isolects. This fact is very important for the reconstruction of a PM ancestor, because for SM\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nChapter 5 describes the Minangkabau system of voice and verbal morphology. In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4).

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds.

For example, can you say ***the man** is running **big*** to mean ‘**the big man** is running’? \n\nTypically a language which allows this has extensive [agreement](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Agreement) systems so that you can still work out what modifies what in the NP without them being adjacent (e.g. the ‘Australian type’). NPs that are made up of several coordinated NPs that can be interpreted by the verb or other elements are not relevant here. This features aims specifically to capture the phenomenon of a single NP whose property words can occur outside of and not immediately adjacent to the portion of the NP that contains the head. Examples of the type *I painted the house red* or *I saw the boy big* are not necessarily discontinuous, but most likely resultative or contrastive (*I saw the boy big* [as opposed to before when he was small]). These should be disregarded for the purposes of this feature.\n\nNote that for the purposes of this feature only property words (e.g. *tall*, *red*, *friendly*) should be considered. Any other elements described as 'adjectives' or 'adjectival' in the grammatical description (e.g. quantifiers, demonstratives) should be disregarded in coding this feature.\n\n",

Code 1 if there are any sentences illustrating noun phrases where the adnominal property word is separated from the noun phrase whose head it modifies, such as *The man is running big.* to mean ‘The big man is running.’\n2.

Code 1 if the grammar specifically states that the language allows adnominal property words to occur in a position separated from the remainder of the nominal phrase whose head they modify.\n4. If discontinuous adnominal property words are not mentioned and there are no example sentences that show this phenomenon, code 0.\n5. If there is an extensive agreement system, exhaust all resources to discover whether discontinuous adnominal property words are possible, even if they are not mentioned in the grammar.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Marika is described as ‘a people’ in Howison (1801) and as ‘people, persons; an armour-bearer, esquire’ in Marsden (1812). It may be borrowed from Old Javanese, which has marika, an emphatic article which apparently also functioned as a*\nvery likely, but the connection of b- with +(a)ba is too conjectural.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.\n"

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source).

In IBN this happened through prefixation of di-, and in the other isolects through prefixation of s-; in SM locative pronouns are usually precliticised by a locative preposition (viz. di ‘in, at’, kə ‘to(wards)’, and dari ‘from’). This leads to the following reconstructions:\n*(?)-(i)ni(?) ‘here’; ^l)-(i)tu(f) ‘there’; *(?)-(i)na(n) / *(?)-(a)na(?) ‘yonder’.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\napa mana mana siapa bila\n\nbar/a\n\nsa?apa\n\nindefinite\n\nanu\n\nanu\n\nanu\n\n(tu)apo mano -mano siapo kəbilo\nbaxapo\nanu\n\nnama ni -ni sapa kamaya\nbər/apa məsak\nanu?\n\napd mand -mani siapð kapan\nbər/apð\nanu/anð\n\n5.5.2.1 Demonstrative pronouns\nMost isolects have- a bipartite series of demonstratives, but it is likely that PM had a tripartite series: this would be in analogy with the locative pronouns (5.5.2.2) and with the IBN demonstratives. Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source). Nor do I have an explanation for the IBN demonstratives (note their agreement with Tagalog, which has itð referring to things close to the speaker).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nIn many AN languages there is an ongoing process of replacement by plural personal pronouns of singular ones that were felt to be too familiar, too impolite and/or too direct. It is quite possible that already in PM distinctions like polite versus familiar played a crucial role. However, a singuɪar/pɪuraɪ distinction is reconstructed for PM because it also apparently existed in PMP, and because the PMP plural personal pronouns are reflected in the isolects with retention of their plural meaning (viz. all isolects except JKT reflect PMP *(i)kita, and PMP *(i)kami, Classical Malay and SWY reflect PMP *(i)kamu, and IBN reflects PMP *si-iDa, all with retention of the plural notion).\n\n(2) In Classical Malay there occurs a series of personal pronouns viz. daku, dikaw, and dia, which is a variant of the series aku, əŋkaw and ia (dia is still a very frequent variant of ia).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n5.5.2 Other pronouns\n\ndemonstrative (this) (that) (yonder)\n\nSM\nini itu nu(n)\n\nlocative (here) (there) (yonder)\n\n-sini -situ -sana\n\nrelative\n\nyag\n\nMIN iko/ko itu/tu\nsiko situ sinan na(N)\n\nBH\n\nSWY\n\nini/nib ini ituh/tuh itu\n\nsia/sini sini\n\nsitu\n\nsitu\n\nsana\n\nsano\n\nnag\n\nno\n\nIBN\ntu7 na7 hin\nditu7 dia7 diin\nti/kə\n\nJKT\nini/ni itu/tu/to/(ðnð) (ðnð)\nsini/mari situ sonð\nyag/nag/nag\n\n173Zoetmulder gives for Old Javanese marika ‘emphatic article, including ika', and for ika ‘demonstrative\npronoun: that, those (of what is at some distance from the speaker); often: ne, she, it (equivalent to a personal pronoun of the third person)’.\n\n\f127\n\ninterrogative (what) (which) (where) (who) (when) (how much, how many)\n\napa mana -mana siapa bila/kapan\nbər/apa\n\napo, a mano/ma -mano/-ma siapo/sia bilo\n\napa mana mana siapa bila\n\nbar/a\n\nsa?apa\n\nindefinite\n\nanu\n\nanu\n\nanu\n\n(tu)apo mano -mano siapo kəbilo\nbaxapo\nanu\n\nnama ni -ni sapa kamaya\nbər/apa məsak\nanu?\n\napd mand -mani siapð kapan\nbər/apð\nanu/anð\n"

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

According to Helfrich stress falls on the penultimate syllable of a word, unless this contains a schwa (in which case it falls on the final syllable); stress is not phonemic, and there are no other phonemic suprasegmental features.\n\n2.4.2 SWY MORPHOPHONEMIC ALTERNATIONS\n\nA. Nasalisation of actor-oriented verbs, affixation of the nominalising affixes paN- and paNan, yield the following alternations:\n\n(1) velar nasal accretion for initial vowels, e.g.\n\n(adil): (ikat): (ukur):\n\nŋadili ‘give judgement’, paŋadilan ‘law court’ rpkat‘bind’, pəŋikat‘s.th. to bind’ ŋukur‘measure’, pəŋukur‘measurer, gauger’\n\n(2) homorganic nasal substitution for initial stops, e.g.\n\n(potfi(h)): (pikul): (bali): (buka7): (dagax): (dapat): (timbo): (tufijiP7): (cukur): (jaliŋ): (jait): (kapur) (in (kildr): (gundal): (gantuŋ):\n\nHelfrich\n\nkapux):\n\nmotp(h) ‘make white’ pamikul ‘s.o. carrying a yoke’ mali ‘buy’ pəmuka 7 ‘entrepreneur’ nayax ‘hear’ pənapat ‘opinion’ nimbo ‘bale (water)’ pənunju37 ‘pointer’ nukiir ‘shave’, pafiukur ‘barber’ nəliŋ ‘look sidelong, squint’ panait ‘dressmaker, n*eedle ŋapur ‘whitewash’ pərpjdr‘a file’ ŋundali ‘throw at (s.th.)’ pəŋantuŋan ‘place to hang s.th.’\n\nN.B. As the above examples show, in Aliana et al. stops become homorganic nasals. Helfrich, however, is vague about the exact nature of nasalisation of stops, but from his examples it appears that voiceless stops usually become homorganic nasals, and that voiced stops usually have homorganic nasal accretion. Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\naN- is to some extent comparable with SM maN(2)- although apparently it does not occur on the basis of VSIs, and alternates with the transitive marker N- in a few cases (see above).\n\n6.3.6 JKT\nJKT N(l)-, 0-, di-, are equivalent to SM məiv(l)-, 0-, di-. N(l)- has several variants: məiv(l)-, N(l)-, and pə(l)-. moN(l)- is in most cases interchangeable with N(l)- and seems to be favoured in formal speech (Muhadjir 1981:46). N(l)- and pə(l)- are partly in complementary distribution and partly in free alternation: pə(l)- is a morphophonemic alternation of M* l) before a liquid or a semivowel, or if the base is monosyllabic, and it is in free variation with it before voiced stops (ef. 2.6.2). di- is also favoured in imperative sentences, e.g.\n(24) Tu sayur jaŋan digaddin! that vegetable don't di- + eat.s.th.without.rice Don't eat those vegetables without rice!\n(25) Diminum tu td-ne! di- + drink that tea-your (polite) Please drink your tea!\nThe distribution of N(2)- and its variants maN(2)- and ŋa(l')-') is equivalent to that of SM maN(2)- and its variants.\n\n\f159\n\n6.3.7 Discussion of sm\n\n0-, di-, and maN(2)-, and their correspondences\n\nIn Malayic isolects, there occur correspondences of SM moN(l)-, or simply nasalisation of the beginning of a stem, or a combination of both. In all isolects but IB.N, there are correspondences of SM maN(2)-, which are formally identical to correspondences of SM məiv(l)-, anð which all form intransitive verbs.. Further, the morphophonemic alternations of SM maN(l)-, SM maN(2)-, and their correspondences, and of mere nasalisation, also differ from one isolect to the other. So there are three problems involved in the reconstruction of PM ancestors of SM moN(l)- etc. and SM maN(2)- etc.:\n\n(1) did they have the form mAN- or *N- ? (2) what morphophonemic alternations did they exhibit? (3) were there any formal or functional differences between them?\n\nThese three problems will be considered in turn.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nFrom the above chart it appears that all isolects agree in showing homorganic nasal substitution for initial p, t, k, and palatal nasal substitution for s, and no change at all before initial nasal. Except for IBN, they all agree in showing homorganic nasal accretion before initial voiced stops (in SWY homorganic nasal accretion is still found in Helfrich's description, whereas voiced stops are replaced by homorganic nasals in Aliana et al.; cases with homorganic nasal replacement of voiced stops in Helfrich are incidental, 2.4.2). One could argue that nasalisation originally did not occur before liquids, and that it appeared in this position in IBN and JKT because of the need for a formal indication of agentorientedness.\nBut it is not possible to reconstruct a sound set of morphophonemic alternations for *mAN(l)- apart from that of homorganic nasal accretion before voiced stops, homorganic nasal substitution for initial *p, *t, *k, palatal nasal substitution for initial *s, and loss of the ★N in *mAN(l)- before an initial nasal.\n\n\f161\n\nAs for *mAN(2)-, it apparently had the same morphophonemic alternations as *mAN(l)-: only IBN has a different set of alternations, but since the IBN distinction between nasal substitution and nasal accretion as an indication of transitivity and intransitivity respectively is not found elsewhere among Malay isolects, it will not play a part in the reconstruction of PM. The difference between PM *mAN(l)- and *mAN(2)-, then, was only a functional one.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n178\ndegree. The valency of kə- -an(l) etc. differs from one isolect to the other, and the only feature common to all isolects (except IBN) is that they have ka- -an(l) etc. affixed to nouns. But kə- -an( 1) etc. also occurs with verbs in SM, MIN, SWY, and JKT, and I will reconstruct a PM ancestor which occurred on the basis of verbs and nouns, and which denoted unintentionality and feasibility. As to its function of forming comparatives with VSIs in MIN and of forming excessives with VSIs in BH, this is an even smaller base for a PM reconstruction than in the case of tor- etc. with VSIs (cf. 6.2.2). Since kə- -an(V) and ter- etc. are to a great extent similar in function and meaning, a difference in distribution would be expected between them. However, I have not been able to discover any such difference that would hold for all isolects.\nAll isolects except IBN have a correspondence Of SM kə- -an(2) occurring with VSIs and forming nouns referring to the quality denoted by (VSI). JKT kə- -an(T), however, may not be inherited. SM kə- -an(2) and MIN ka- -an(2) also occur with VDIs (forming abstract nouns, and nouns referring to the place where the action is performed). In BH, ka- -an(2) is found with VDIs, but here the resulting noun exclusively refers to the place where the action is performed. It is therefore possible to reconstruct a PM ancestral form of SM ka- -an(2) which on the basis of VSIs formed nouns referring to the quality of (VSI) as such, and which on the basis of VDIs formed nouns at least referring to the place where (VDI) takes place.\n"

            "summary": "This question concerns a bound grammatical marker of plural number on nouns. This feature contrasts with [GB318\tIs plural number regularly marked in the noun phrase by a phonologically free element?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB318) which focuses on non-bound marking of plural number. For more on bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). Bound marking of number on nouns derived from other word classes (such as adjectives or verbs) does not suffice for a 1. Reduplication (full or partial) does not count for this feature.\n\nThe marker should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. Classes of animate nouns or human nouns are large and open enough. Kinship terms however are a restricted set since it is very hard to add new members.\n\nNumber marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and be coded as 1, as long as these other functions do not interfere with the number distinctions and as long as number marking is productive and regular.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Consider the section in the grammar that deals with number or nominal morphology.\n2. If the author describes a bound marker of plural number on the noun that occurs regularly, code 1.\n3. If the only marking of plural number occurs on nouns derived from other word classes (adjectives, verbs etc.) or on a small subset of all nouns, code 0.\n4. If the only marking of plural number is accomplished by reduplication, code 0.\n5. If the grammar mentions that plural number is not marked productively, or that it is marked somewhere else than on the noun, code as 0.\n6. If the grammar does not describe number marking at all and you have a reason to believe that the author may have missed it, code ?.\n7. If the grammar does not describe number, you encounter no examples of number marking, and the grammar is otherwise comprehensive, code 0.\n\n",
            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n(3) It seems that the function that must be attributed to *mAN(].')- is that of agent-oriented verb marker, since this is the function of its reflexes in the isolects. By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-. There are, however, some important reasons not to reconstruct a prefix for this correspondence set:\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nAs it is, it is not possible to make definite statements about the history of JKT -an( 1,2) and its reflex (or reflexes) in PM.

It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them.

The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive.

It was argued that this class of lexical/derivational devices function to show a conceptually motivated system of voice oppositions and that this voice system can be usefully described in terms of Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework. Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n(51) a.\n\nBaju itame tu\n\nnan gaek-gaek tu.\n\nshirt black-3 DEM:dist REL RED-old DEM:dist\n\n‘The old people wear black shirts.’\n\n(Text ID: 445038115055260406)\n73\n\n\fb.

In Acehnese transitive verbs, the agents are compulsorily referenced by proclitics whereas undergoers are only optionally referenced by enclitics. The presence of undergoer enclitics implies that the undergoer is topical therefore it is rare to have a undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is topical (Durie, 1985a: 201-06).

(N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

As such, the prefix can be used with active intransitive verb roots, transitive verb roots and ditransitive verb roots (see Chapter 4) where its role is to show that the actor has been selected as the pivot. However, maN- can also affix to noun roots and stative verb roots. In this case, maN- not only marks the fact that the pivot is aligned with the actor role, it has the additional derivational effect of altering underlying argument structure of the root (see Section 5.1.2.3).\n124\n"

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nvarious inflections (which show the word’s ‘accidents’ or properties). The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nthus equating them with adjectives, or do we negate both the operators, describing them as [-noun, -verb] and leaving no way of distinguishing them from adpositions? What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nChomsky’s (1970) classification system also suggests that certain parts of speech are incompatible because their feature specifications are diametrically opposed; nouns and verbs cannot form a natural class and neither can adjectives and adpositions. Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

See the [classification wiki page](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-Classes-and-Classifiers) for more information on our definition of noun class/gender. Noun class/gender assignment may be based on one or several factors. This feature focuses on whether the animacy of a noun is one of these factors for a given language. There must be a clear preference for certain nouns to be classified in certain gender categories as a result of their animacy for this feature to be coded 1. That is, animacy must be a relevant factor in the assignment of gender; however it does not need to be an absolute deciding factor or the only relevant factor in gender/class assignment. \n\nNote that while masculine and feminine categories are generally associated with animate referents, a gender system that makes a distinction between these categories is not necessarily sufficient to trigger a 1 here. A gender system in which animacy is a relevant factor will often make a distinction between human or animal referents and non-living referents, and animate status may be extended to culturally important non-living entities (e.g. mythological figures) or objects (e.g. celestial bodies). A human/non-human distinction is sufficient for a 1 code.\n\n",

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nQuestions about categorisation have also been asked about a number of Austronesian languages related to Minangkabau. Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nvarious inflections (which show the word’s ‘accidents’ or properties). The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nthus equating them with adjectives, or do we negate both the operators, describing them as [-noun, -verb] and leaving no way of distinguishing them from adpositions? What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n4.2.1 Open Class Items\n4.2.1.1 Nouns\nSection 4.1.3.2 established that the prototypical function of nouns is to refer (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1).

The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b).

Gil (2000: 192) argues that similar constructions\n63\n\n\fin Malay, for example rumah Bobok, ‘Bobok’s house’ are in fact nominative attributive constructions. This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’.

            "summary": "This question concerns whether there is an independent [classifier](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Noun-classes-and-classifiers) system in possessive constructions that is not related to other nominal classification systems such as the gender/noun class of the language or numeral classifiers. \n\nWe are concerned with markers that signal the nature of the possessor (possessor classifiers) or the possessum (possessed classifiers). This feature applies to both pronominal/nominal possessors and markers which are [bound or free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence). Possessive classifiers need not be obligatory, it may also be possible to construct possessive phrases without possessive classifiers.\n\nDifferences in the expression of individual, joint, separate and group possession are not relevant here.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Code 1 if there are elements which are used, but not necessarily obligatory, in possessive constructions, which vary according to the semantic class of the possessor noun or the possessed noun,\n2. And these elements are not the same as markers of the noun class/gender system, or other classifier systems such as numeral classifiers,\n3. And these elements are not normally used when the noun is used in non-possessive constructions.\n4. There need to be at least two markers (i.e. not just a possessive marker and the absence of a possessive marker).\n\n\n",

Crowley, 2002), nor does it have regular diminutive forming processes.\n\nSome examples of these formal properties of Minangkabau nouns follow in examples (27) to (35). Example (27) shows number marking, examples (28) and (29) show how numerical classifiers work, examples (30), (31) and (32) show how possession is marked, example (33) shows how nouns can also be modified by attributive nouns, and examples (34) and (35) show the use of demonstratives.\n\nExample (27) shows a Minangkabau noun that is marked for number. Number is not morphologically marked in Minangkabau, instead numerals precede the noun. Example (27) illustrates this; the noun taun, year, is preceded by the numeral tigo.\n\n(27)\n\nLai tigo taun lebih kurang.\n\nmore three year more less\n\n‘More or less three years ago.’\n\n(Text ID: 979548152848070306)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also marked by numerical classifiers. Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n(28)\n\nAdo yo lauake saikua\n\nnampak tadi ma.\n\nexist yes fish-3 ONE-CLASS:tail visible before EMPH\n\n‘There was a fish here before.’\n\n(Text ID: 707279021818220506)\n\n(29)\n\nInyo nio bali bara inceknyo?\n\n3\n\nwant buy how.many CLASS:seed-3\n\n‘How many of them does he want to buy?’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nIn many languages, possession is marked morphologically on the noun and languages with case systems tend to encode possession as genitive case marking. In Minangkabau, possession is not morphologically marked on the noun. Instead, the verb punyo, ‘have’, is used to show a possessive relationship between the possessor and the possessed (see example (30)). Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo.

Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.\n"

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes.

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nvarious inflections (which show the word’s ‘accidents’ or properties). The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n5.1.4), and along with voice marking represent the best diagnostic features for identifying verbs.\n(38) VP = ((NP) → (negator) → (TAM) → (voice marking)-VERB-(applicative) → (adverb) → (NP))\nOther parts of speech such as nouns and adverbs can also function predicatively as the head of a VP. In this case, the syntactic frame can be described as a more general ‘predicate construction’ with a predicate (‘PRED’) as its head. The predicate construction is represented in (39) and described in further detail in Section 4.3.\n(39) Predicate Construction =\n((NP) → (negator) → (TAM) → (voice marking)-PRED-(applicative) → (adverb) → (NP))\nMinangkabau verbs also display many of the formal properties of verbs described by Anderson (1985). These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes. Table 10 lists each of these formal properties of verbs and describes how these properties are realised in Minangkabau.\n67\n\n\fTable 10.

The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds.

Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957).

Non-core arguments are typically adjunct-like and their non-core status is often marked by the presence of adpositions (Arka, 2003b).\n\nSo, in contrast to the symmetric passive construction, in Standard Indonesian’s asymmetric passive, the actor argument is syntactically demoted and given non-core status (Arka, 2003b; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). This is marked by the presence of the agentive/causal preposition oleh. An example of this can be seen in (6c) where the actor Sul has been given non-core status and is thus preceded by the preposition oleh.\n\nHowever, in the pasif semu, also referred to as the ‘pseudo passive’, the object voice, or passive type two (hereafter the P2 construction), both actor and undergoer are retained as core arguments (Arka and Manning, 2008; Musgrave, 2000). In the P2 construction, the undergoer is selected as the pivot (cf. Chung, 1976a) and precedes the verb. The P2 verb is not marked for voice but hosts a pronominal proclitic coding the actor. The sentence in (7) shows an example of a P2 construction. In this example notice that the undergoer buku ini, ‘this book’, is the pivot and thus precedes the verb, baca, ‘read’.

Kroeger, 1998), Minangkabau does not have any lexical specifications about a verb’s ‘default’ pivot or its basic voice. This idea is supported by the fact that, when bare verbs are used in place of voice marked verbs, the ‘voice’ of the verb and the semantic roles of the verb’s arguments are underspecified (see Section 6.1.2). This suggests that some elements of the verb’s argument structure are dependent on the surface realisation of syntactic structures and voice morphology on the verb. Rather than claiming that the unmarked verb is precategorial, we can propose that some aspects of its argument structure in Minangkabau are underspecified (see Section 6.3.2). We could also propose a solution similar to Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) and argue that some elements of argument structure are specified by the verb root and other elements are specified by the voice marker. The interaction of root with voice marker and the effects that this has on argument structure must depend on the category and semantics of the root.\n6.3.1.2 Nominalisation Processes\nAs discussed in Section 4.2.1.2, Minangkabau has productive nominalising morphology and makes use of three main nominalising affixes: pa-, paN-, and -an.

For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\navailable to undergo a range of syntactic operations, including being selected as the pivot. A non-core argument, on the other hand, is “peripheral” in the sense that it is not as syntactically ‘available’ as a core argument. Non-core arguments are typically adjunct-like and their non-core status is often marked by the presence of adpositions (Arka, 2003b).\n\nSo, in contrast to the symmetric passive construction, in Standard Indonesian’s asymmetric passive, the actor argument is syntactically demoted and given non-core status (Arka, 2003b; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). This is marked by the presence of the agentive/causal preposition oleh. An example of this can be seen in (6c) where the actor Sul has been given non-core status and is thus preceded by the preposition oleh.\n\nHowever, in the pasif semu, also referred to as the ‘pseudo passive’, the object voice, or passive type two (hereafter the P2 construction), both actor and undergoer are retained as core arguments (Arka and Manning, 2008; Musgrave, 2000). In the P2 construction, the undergoer is selected as the pivot (cf. Chung, 1976a) and precedes the verb. The P2 verb is not marked for voice but hosts a pronominal proclitic coding the actor. The sentence in (7) shows an example of a P2 construction. In this example notice that the undergoer buku ini, ‘this book’, is the pivot and thus precedes the verb, baca, ‘read’. The first person actor, ku, then appears as a proclitic on the verb.\n\n(7)\n\nBuku ini\n\nsudah ku=baca.\n\nbook DEM:prox PFCT 1sg=read\n\n‘I have read this book.’\n\n(adapted from Sneddon, 1996: 249)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nalso made between a verb’s core and non-core arguments since applicative formation on transitive roots functions to alter the verb’s existing argument structure by changing the lexically specified alignment between macro role and core or non-core argument.\nHowever, unlike Blaan (cf. Kroeger, 1998), Minangkabau does not have any lexical specifications about a verb’s ‘default’ pivot or its basic voice. This idea is supported by the fact that, when bare verbs are used in place of voice marked verbs, the ‘voice’ of the verb and the semantic roles of the verb’s arguments are underspecified (see Section 6.1.2). This suggests that some elements of the verb’s argument structure are dependent on the surface realisation of syntactic structures and voice morphology on the verb. Rather than claiming that the unmarked verb is precategorial, we can propose that some aspects of its argument structure in Minangkabau are underspecified (see Section 6.3.2). We could also propose a solution similar to Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) and argue that some elements of argument structure are specified by the verb root and other elements are specified by the voice marker. The interaction of root with voice marker and the effects that this has on argument structure must depend on the category and semantics of the root.\n6.3.1.2 Nominalisation Processes\nAs discussed in Section 4.2.1.2, Minangkabau has productive nominalising morphology and makes use of three main nominalising affixes: pa-, paN-, and -an. Like many of the nominalising affixes used in Philippine-type languages, two of the Minangkabau nominalisers, pa- and -an, are apparently homophonous with verbal morphological markers: the causative prefix pa- and the applicative -an respectively (see Section 6.3.1.3). The examples in (285) show how pa- and -an affect the verbal roots to create phonologically identical nominal and verbal forms.\n218\n\n\f(285) ROOT\na. tanam b. tolong c. tamu d. ingek\n\n‘plant’ ‘help’ ‘meet’ ‘remember’\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nHowever, Durie (1985a: 180) does make a distinction between ‘Core Roles’ and ‘nonCore Roles’ in Acehnese.

For example, he suggests that a root like bigay, ‘give’, will specify the conceptual paradigm ‘giving by X of Y to Z’, but will not specify how X, Y and Z’s semantic roles map onto argument structure. The role of voice morphology is then to specify how the semantic roles specified by the root’s conceptual structure ought to be realised syntactically. To do this, the root must first become a verb. So, according to Foley, voice morphology actually performs a single derivational process: deriving a verb from a precategorial root and selecting a specific semantic role as the pivot.\nSince argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, according to Foley (1998; 2008) this means that there is no preference as to which of the participants entailed by the root’s conceptual structure gets realised as the pivot. This, he argues, shows that no one voice type is basic and that voice in Philippine-type languages is ‘symmetrical’ (see Section 2.1). Naturally, precategoriality and symmetrical voice systems are complementary features and it is these features, he argues, that are typologically salient in Philippine-type languages.\nNevertheless, whether Philippine-type languages are precategorial or not is still a matter of debate and a number of alternate analyses have been put forward. Two of these alternate analyses are discussed here.

Jacobson, 1979; Swadesh, 1939), Salishan languages (cf. Jelinek and Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) and Polynesian languages (cf. Broschart, 1997; Mosel and Hovdhaugen, 1992) are said to lack a noun-verb distinction; therefore it cannot be said that the primitive features [±noun] and [±verb] are underlying in these languages. Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52",

Firstly, paN- and its correspondences do not refer to the location where the action or event takes place. An exception to this is IBN paN- which, as the only nominalising affix in IBN, has generalised its meaning in a maximal way. Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT). Fourthly, the syntactical role of SM paN- and MIN paN- is quite different from the (more restricted) role of their correspondences in other isolects. This fact is very important for the reconstruction of a PM ancestor, because for SM\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n(22) a. John pounded the metal flat.\n\n(AP)\n\nb. John threw the ball into the barrel. (PP)\n\nc. *John pounded the metal a sword. (NP)\n\nd. *John polished the table shine.\n\n(VP)\n\n(Baker, 2003: 2)\n\nTypological evidence also reveals further problems with Chomsky’s (1970) framework. For example, Nootkan languages (cf. Jacobson, 1979; Swadesh, 1939), Salishan languages (cf. Jelinek and Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) and Polynesian languages (cf. Broschart, 1997; Mosel and Hovdhaugen, 1992) are said to lack a noun-verb distinction; therefore it cannot be said that the primitive features [±noun] and [±verb] are underlying in these languages. Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nKaufman, D. 2007.

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nB.

The end result has to be a finite verb and cannot, for example, be a deverbal noun or an adverb. Grambank counts the separate elements of circumfixes as affixes. If one of the elements of a circumfix precedes the host it attaches to, we treat it as a prefix.

The resulting form is a noun forming a verbal abstract (particularly in SM) or a noun referring to place (particularly in MIN) or, to a lesser extent, to instrument and object.\nBH paN- -an forms nouns with VSIs, VDIs, and VTRs. These nouns refer to actor or place when their base is a VDI or VTR, and they refer to someone with (VSI) as a characteristic when their base is a VSI.\nIBN does not have a corresponding affix.\nJKT paN- -an forms nouns or VSIs on the basis of VSIs, VDIs, and VTRs. These nouns refer to actor or place when their base is a VTR, or, sometimes, a VDI; with other VDIs, they form an abstract noun or refer to place or to someone who often performs (VDI), and with VSIs they refer to someone who has (VSI) as a habit.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n44:217-69 Sirk, Ülo. 1996.

            "summary": "This question aims to capture productive paradigms of overt tense marking. 'Morphological marking on the verb' means that the marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verb. The marking of tense can involve affixes, clitics, suppletion, tonal marking and/or reduplication. This feature aims to capture overt marking of present tense on the verb. Lack of other marking is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example some grammarians state that present tense is expressed by a certain aspect on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing present tense then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB082) and the feature on tense auxiliaries ([GB121](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB121)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing present tense, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.\n\nSometimes a language is described as having a past/non-past distinction. In this case, if there is an overt marker of non-past code the language as 1 for this feature (GB082), but 0 for the feature on future tense [GB084](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB084). Future tense needs to be more dedicated to actual future reference, whereas present tense has less strict demands on the scope of its function. This situation is mirrored for future/non-future which results in a 1 for GB082 and GB084 but a 0 for GB083 (if both have over markers). It is however not acceptable for a present tense marker to occur in both future and past contexts.\n\nIf there is a tense system with a \"hodiernal\" category, i.e \"the day of speaking\", that also includes past events of the same day, this is permissible to code as a present tense marker.\n\n",

In this case, the syntactic frame can be described as a more general ‘predicate construction’ with a predicate (‘PRED’) as its head. The predicate construction is represented in (39) and described in further detail in Section 4.3.\n(39) Predicate Construction =\n((NP) → (negator) → (TAM) → (voice marking)-PRED-(applicative) → (adverb) → (NP))\nMinangkabau verbs also display many of the formal properties of verbs described by Anderson (1985). These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes.

Positing an original excessive meaning has the advantage of putting the origin of tor- etc. + VSIs more in line with for- etc. + VTRs, VDIs or precategorials (i.e. with tor- with an unintentional meaning). This means that only one PM prefix would need to be reconstructed for both, with an unintentional and excessive meaning combined with a potential one; this prefix would have occurred with all verbs (VSIs, VDIs, VTRs, precategorials). But with the evidence at hand it is safer to limit oneself to what can actually be reconstructed with certainty. That is a PM prefix *tAr-, which occurred at least with VTRs and VDIs (including precategorials), and which conveyed the notion of unintentionality and potentiality. The subject of a *£Ar- form was either object or (involuntary) agent of the performance.\n6.2.8 Reconstruction of *tAr-\nI reconstruct *£Ar-, which contributed the notion of unintentionality or feasibility to the VTR or VDI to which it was affixed.

            "summary": "This question aims to capture [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) paradigms of overt tense marking. 'Morphological marking on the verb' means that the marker has to form a [phonological unit](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) with the verb. The marking of tense can involve affixes, clitics, suppletion, tonal marking and/or reduplication. This feature aims to capture overt marking of future tense on the verb. Lack of other marking is not enough. There are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and an auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that future tense is expressed by a certain marker on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing future tense then this construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB084) and the feature on tense auxiliaries ([GB121](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB121)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing future tense, only consider the marking that is obligatory.\n\nSometimes a language will be described as having a past/non-past distinction. In this case, if there is an overt marker of non-past code the language as 1 for the feature on present tense ([GB082](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB082)), but 0 for this feature (GB084). Future tense needs to be more dedicated to actual future reference, whereas present tense has less strict demands on the scope of its function.\n\nIt can be hard to distinguish future tense from different modal categories, after all if something is in the future it has not yet occurred and can be construed as something wished for, planned, intended, etc. For this reason, it is necessary to pay particular attention to sections on mood, especially irrealis, when coding for future tense.\n\nIf a language only has future tense under negation, this does not count for this feature. It needs to be present for affirmation as well. The reason for this is that conditions such as 'only under negation' are likely to give rise to quite different analysis by different linguists (hence it is hard to ensure comparability) and might also be overlooked. If we were to treat such marginal cases as triggering 1 we would most likely have to go back to a lot of the cases that were coded as 0 and re-evaluate their coding more thoroughly.\n\n",

If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing imperfective aspect then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB086) and the feature on aspectual auxiliaries ([GB120](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB120) and/or [GB520](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB520)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing imperfective aspect, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.\n\nPlease take notice that this feature (GB086) and the features on aspectual auxiliaries [GB120](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB120) and particles [GB520](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB520) do not cover exactly the same functions. The features on auxiliaries and particles cover more grammatical aspects than just perfective and imperfective. \n\nIf this distinction is only available in some TAM-conditions, this counts as well. For example, if there is no aspectual distinction in the past but it only exists in the present, this still triggers a 1.\n\n",

Contrastively, example (10) shows the use of the di- verbs ditumbok, ‘mash’, and diminum, ‘drink’. According to Rafferty (1982: 46), in this example the verbs refer to “real (past, present or future) events” and that the di- prefix therefore encodes perfective aspect.\n\n(9)\n\nPas amblas barangkali mbalekno hondae.\n\nexact disappear perhaps N-return-3sg Honda-that\n\n‘(He’s) completely disappeared, (he’s) probably returning a/the motorbike.’\n\n(Rafferty, 1982: 44)\n\n(10)\n\nSuru ditumbok sebelume pagi, sebelume makan itu diminum.\n\nask di-mash before-it morning, before-it eat that di-drink\n\n‘(She) told me to mash (it), and in the morning, before eating, to drink (it).’\n\n(Rafferty, 1982: 46)\n\nHopper (1979) has also argued that the Indonesian-type language Early Modern Malay had a distinction between imperfective and perfective clauses. However, he argues that the aspectual distinctions are a result of some clauses being foregrounding, i.e. they are central to the development of the narrative and are perfective, and some clauses being backgrounding, i.e. they provide information that supports, but is not central to, the main events of the narrative and are imperfective. He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nInterestingly, Davies’ (2005) study of Madurese, which is an Indonesian-type language spoken in Madura and East Java, suggests that the active and passive voice markers in this language are also used to encode a foregrounding/backgrounding distinction and are associated with an aspectual distinction. Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-. Foregrounding clauses were also more likely to be perfective, and backgrounding clauses to be imperfective. He argues then that e- and Nare associated with this aspectual distinction not categorically, but by virtue of their appearance in foregrounding and backgrounding clauses respectively.\n\nExamples (11) and (12) come from a recounting of the folk tale Bang Mera so Bang Pote, ‘Onion and Garlic’, which tells of the fate of two sisters named Onion and Garlic. In (11) we see an example of active voice used in a clause containing background information. In (12) we see use of the “object voice” in a foreground clause used to describe an “action that moves the story forward” (Davies, 2005: 213).\n\n(11)\n\nReng lake’ gelle’ ngrabadi Bang.Pote.\n\nperson male previous AV-care-APP Garlic\n\n‘The man took care of Garlic.’\n\n(Davies, 2005: 213)\n\n(12)\n\nSamper gelle’ etabang bi’ Bang.Pote.\n\ncloth\n\nprevious OV-search with Garlic\n\n‘Garlic searched for the cloth.’\n\n(Davies, 2005: 213)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nCiting evidence from Tagalog, Kimaragang Dusun and Blaan, Kroeger (1998) argues that nominal and verbal roots in Philippine-type languages can be distinguished in the lexicon. He argues that the argument structure of a verb is underlying therefore the role of voice affixation is not as Foley (1998) claims to derive verbs from precategorial roots, but purely to select a participant as the pivot.\nKroeger (1998) gives four significant pieces of evidence to support his claims. The first is that applicative formation can alter the argument structure of a verb independently of focus or voice marking. Applicatives operate as valency changing devices and also\n214\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nThe aspectual properties of di- are more likely to occur as a ‘side effect’ of the clitic’s primary function as a marker of passive voice, rather than the clitic functioning exclusively as an aspect marker. In fact, passive clauses cross-linguistically are generally associated with telic or perfective aspect. Hopper (1979) argues that just as the active voice is used in Classical Malay in backgrounded clauses, the passive voice is\n\n144\n"

Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

However, the pervasive use of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau have meant that the properties that make the P2 construction distinct in Standard Minangkabau do not apply in Colloquial Minangkabau. In fact, the evidence suggests that the P2 construction has merged with the bare active construction in the Colloquial variety.\n\nAs described in Section 5.1.4, the P2 construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau has a restrictive set of word order constraints. In Standard Minangkabau, nothing must intervene between the actor and the verb in a P2 clause, therefore all auxiliaries (i.e. negators and TAM adverbials) must precede the actor, whereas in a Standard Minangkabau active sentence, auxiliaries can intervene between the actor and the verb. In fact, if these clausal components occurred before the actor NP, then the sentence’s acceptability would be very much reduced. We do not find these word order constraints in Colloquial Minangkabau and in fact find that clauses with bare verbs allow both ‘auxiliary + actor’ and ‘actor + auxiliary’ word orders.\n\nFor example, consider the sentences in (266) which show that there are no constraints on the ordering of the actor NP and the auxiliary components in an active clause.\n\n(266) a. b. c.\n\nInyo acok ubah gayanyo.\n3 often change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo ubah gayanyo.\noften 3 change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo maubah gayanyo.\noften 3 AV-change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\n(Elicitation)\n\n199",

In the Malay/Indonesian P2 construction, the verb is not marked for voice and the actor-verb word order of an active sentence is retained. However, the undergoer occurs in pre-verbal position and is assigned pivot status (Chung, 1976a). In the Malay/Indonesian di- passive construction, the actor is clearly demoted to non-core argument status, whereas the actor in a P2 clause remains a core argument of the verb (Arka and Manning, 2008; Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006).

Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”",

However, the pervasive use of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau have meant that the properties that make the P2 construction distinct in Standard Minangkabau do not apply in Colloquial Minangkabau. In fact, the evidence suggests that the P2 construction has merged with the bare active construction in the Colloquial variety.\n\nAs described in Section 5.1.4, the P2 construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau has a restrictive set of word order constraints. In Standard Minangkabau, nothing must intervene between the actor and the verb in a P2 clause, therefore all auxiliaries (i.e. negators and TAM adverbials) must precede the actor, whereas in a Standard Minangkabau active sentence, auxiliaries can intervene between the actor and the verb. In fact, if these clausal components occurred before the actor NP, then the sentence’s acceptability would be very much reduced. We do not find these word order constraints in Colloquial Minangkabau and in fact find that clauses with bare verbs allow both ‘auxiliary + actor’ and ‘actor + auxiliary’ word orders.\n\nFor example, consider the sentences in (266) which show that there are no constraints on the ordering of the actor NP and the auxiliary components in an active clause.\n\n(266) a. b. c.\n\nInyo acok ubah gayanyo.\n3 often change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo ubah gayanyo.\noften 3 change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo maubah gayanyo.\noften 3 AV-change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\n(Elicitation)\n\n199\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nfunction to promote non-core arguments to core argument status. For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nThe P2 construction in Standard Minangkabau closely resembles the P2 construction of Malay/Indonesian. In the Malay/Indonesian P2 construction, the verb is not marked for voice and the actor-verb word order of an active sentence is retained. However, the undergoer occurs in pre-verbal position and is assigned pivot status (Chung, 1976a). In the Malay/Indonesian di- passive construction, the actor is clearly demoted to non-core argument status, whereas the actor in a P2 clause remains a core argument of the verb (Arka and Manning, 2008; Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006). A further distinguishing feature of the P2 construction is that no auxiliaries (i.e. negators and TAM adverbials) may intervene between the actor and the verb (Sneddon, 1996: 249) (see Section 2.2).\n145\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nExample (187a) is a canonical bare active construction in which the actor pivot aden precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo follows the verb. Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”\n"

He argues that a Core Role is a participant licensed by the\n34\n\n\fverb’s argument structure that is syntactically ‘available’. Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988).

He argues that a Core Role is a participant licensed by the\n34\n\n\fverb’s argument structure that is syntactically ‘available’. Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988).

The sessions were transcribed using Audacity, an open source digital audio editing programme, and then kept in an electronic database using the Filemaker Pro programme.\nElicitation and community fieldwork involve a number of important ethical considerations. A good overview of the ethics of linguistic fieldwork can be found in Crowley (2007), Dwyer (2006), Mosel (2006) and many of the articles found in Newman and Ratliff (2001). Reading about the ethics of fieldwork can help prepare the researcher for what to expect but it is important to remember that every community is different and that any unexpected problems that do arise can only be resolved in consultation with the community. My project was designed to comply with standard human ethics research protocol to ensure the best interests of the language consultants with whom I conducted elicitation work. Language consultants were recruited through an informed consent process and their thoughts about the methodologies and goals of the research were considered throughout my fieldwork. Every effort was made to maintain a sensitive and balanced relationship with the language consultants and to ensure that they were recompensed for their time spent on the project.\n3.3 Differentiating Standard Minangkabau and Colloquial Minangkabau\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nCiting evidence from Tagalog, Kimaragang Dusun and Blaan, Kroeger (1998) argues that nominal and verbal roots in Philippine-type languages can be distinguished in the lexicon. He argues that the argument structure of a verb is underlying therefore the role of voice affixation is not as Foley (1998) claims to derive verbs from precategorial roots, but purely to select a participant as the pivot.\nKroeger (1998) gives four significant pieces of evidence to support his claims. The first is that applicative formation can alter the argument structure of a verb independently of focus or voice marking. Applicatives operate as valency changing devices and also\n214\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nfunction to promote non-core arguments to core argument status. For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.\n"

These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point. Thus voice marking encodes how the action originates “origin of action”, how the action progresses “development of action”, and how and where the action ends “termination of action” (Shibatani, 2006). For example, transitive actions typically end in the patient being affected, however in some events, the action terminates at a third entity, perhaps a recipient or a benefactor, thus the focus is on the end point of the action. If voice marking encodes this kind of situation type then it can be said to show the “termination of action”. Types of voice marking that fall into this category include benefactives, malefactives and applicatives (Shibatani, 2006: 240). Other types of voice marking used to encode distinctions at each point in the “evolution of action” are listed in Table 16.\n\nTable 16.

            "summary": "Marking strategies of core participants include both marking by [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) and by flagging (i.e. case or adposition marking). Variations in marking strategies include both variations in the alignment patterns and variations in position (e.g. suffixing vs. prefixing) in case of indexes. Mere differences in forms of the indexes triggered by various conjugation classes are not sufficient for a 1. This question includes cases referred to as person-based (alignment) split and hierarchical alignment in the literature. \n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Consider whether there is any variation in the form of the argument indexes on the verb (coded in [GB089](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB089)–[GB094](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB094)) related to the person of arguments (first vs. second vs. third).\n2. If there is some variation, code 1 if this results in different alignment patterns. \n3. Code 1 if the position of indexes differs (prefix/proclitic vs. suffix/clitic), even if the overall alignment pattern remains the same.\n4. The alternation between zero marking indexing for some persons and overt indexing for other persons does not suffice for 1.\n5. Consider flagging. Code 1 if case/adposition marking of S, A, or P arguments (coded in [GB408](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB408), [GB409](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB409), and [GB410](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB410)) varies according to the person of the marked argument.\n6. Code 0 if there is no variation in indexing or flagging according to person, even if other referential properties of arguments, such as animacy, number, pronominal vs. nominal status, matter.\n7. Code 0 if person distinctions only trigger different overt allomorphs of flagging or indexing, but the overall alignment pattern and the position of the markers remains the same.\n\n",
            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nis marked to indicate the discourse relevance of its actor and undergoer participants, i.e. the degree of participant involvement in the event as well as the degree of participant relevance according to the context.\n\nShibatani (2006) observes that although active/passive voice systems (as well as direct/inverse voice systems and Philippine-type voice systems) are pragmatically motivated, voice oppositions ultimately encode conceptual phenomena. These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point. Thus voice marking encodes how the action originates “origin of action”, how the action progresses “development of action”, and how and where the action ends “termination of action” (Shibatani, 2006). For example, transitive actions typically end in the patient being affected, however in some events, the action terminates at a third entity, perhaps a recipient or a benefactor, thus the focus is on the end point of the action. If voice marking encodes this kind of situation type then it can be said to show the “termination of action”. Types of voice marking that fall into this category include benefactives, malefactives and applicatives (Shibatani, 2006: 240). Other types of voice marking used to encode distinctions at each point in the “evolution of action” are listed in Table 16.\n\nTable 16. Types of conceptual voice marking.\n\n(Shibatani, 2006)\n\nEVOLUTION OF ACTION 1. Origin of an action:\n2. Development of an action:\n3. Termination of an action:\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nHowever, Durie (1985a: 180) does make a distinction between ‘Core Roles’ and ‘nonCore Roles’ in Acehnese. He argues that a Core Role is a participant licensed by the\n34\n\n\fverb’s argument structure that is syntactically ‘available’. Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988). An example of this construction can be found in (19).\n\n(19) a.\n\nGopnyan ka geu=côm lôn.\n\nshe\n\nalready 3-kiss\n\nI\n\n‘She (already) kissed me.’\n\nb. Lôn ka\n\ngeu=côm lé gopnyan.\n\nI already 3=kiss\n\nby she\n\n‘I’ve (already) been kissed by her.’\n\n(adapted from Lawler, 1977: 225)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nfunction to promote non-core arguments to core argument status. For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nCiting evidence from Tagalog, Kimaragang Dusun and Blaan, Kroeger (1998) argues that nominal and verbal roots in Philippine-type languages can be distinguished in the lexicon. He argues that the argument structure of a verb is underlying therefore the role of voice affixation is not as Foley (1998) claims to derive verbs from precategorial roots, but purely to select a participant as the pivot.\nKroeger (1998) gives four significant pieces of evidence to support his claims. The first is that applicative formation can alter the argument structure of a verb independently of focus or voice marking. Applicatives operate as valency changing devices and also\n214\n"

In fact, the presence of a post verbal ‘dek + actor’ phrase is incompatible with active voice syntax as examples (257) and (258) illustrate.\n\n(257) a. b. c.\n\nTapi nyo agiahe dek urang ceke.\nbut 3 give-3 CAUSE person talk-3\n‘But he was given it by someone, he said.’\n(Text ID: 474934091648030406)\nTapi nyo diagiahe dek urang ceke.\nbut 3 PV-give-3 CAUSE person talk-3\n‘But he was given it by someone, he said.’\n(Elicitation)\n*Tapi nyo maagiahe dek urang ceke.\nbut 3 AV-give-3 CAUSE person talk-3\n(Elicitation)\n\n(258) a. b. c.\n"

This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan.

The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.\n"

The data shows that even without an applicative, the recipient can appear in a core argument position, indicating that there is potential for identical marking. Although the preference might be for an applicative construction to license a recipient, the existence of colloquial examples without overt applicative usage suggests that marking can be similar. This fulfills the requirement for coding as 1, as the possibility exists even if not all verbs consistently follow this pattern.",

The morphological marking of these arguments (e.g. accusative case, dative case vs. adposition marking) is irrelevant for counting a construction as ditransitive.\n\n‘Marking’ for the purposes of this feature includes both flagging (i.e. case and adposition marking) and [indexing](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Indexing-vs.-pronouns) on the verb. 1 is primarily triggered by flagging.

Verbal affixes are derivational or inflectional (the latter are focus-markers); nominal affixes are derivational. Cliticised reflexes of *sa ? (> MIN, BH sa, o.i. sə-) are treated in 5.3.2; reflexes of the clitic *-ha (> SM, BH -na, MIN -no, -no, -o, -e, SWY -no, -o, JKT -nd) are treated in 5.5.1.3. Transitivising affixes (SM -i, -kan, BH -i, -akan, SWY -i, -ka(n)/-kə, IBN -ka, JKT -in; SM (məm)pər-, MIN (mam)pa-, BH (ta)pa-, IBN p(ə)-) and reflexes of PM *(mb)Ar- (> SM bər-, MIN, BH ba-, o.i. bə-) have already been treated in Adelaar (1984a); a short account of this treatment is given below in 6.1.1,6.1.2.\nVerbs can be either simple or derived. For instance, transitive verbs are either transitive sui generis or secondarily derived from nouns or other verbs. Derived transitive verbs are subject to some of the same morphological processes as primary verbal bases (the derivative\nVDIs and VSIs by testing their valency with the verb məfijadi ‘become’ is from Hein Steinhauer.

For instance, Muhadjir's definition includes root morphemes with multiple-class membership, components of (partial or entire) reduplication that do\nnot occur in other environments (e.g. kure, grate and cdddt would be precategorial roots in the words kurikuri ‘turtle’, grakgrikgruk ‘sound like one who has a cough or a cold’, and eəeðɑdt ‘bat’), lexemes denoting a unit of money such as pdrak ‘rupiah’, and even loanwords deriving from prepositional phrases in the lending language (ef. alakadar ‘what is available (adv.)’ < AR cala qadr ‘commensurate with, corresponding to,\n"

Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6).

An example of this is English *went* and *go*. In this case, the verb is suppletive for tense. Only strong suppletion (different stems) counts. There should be at least three verbs with participant number suppletion to count as 1. If only one or two verbs are described as exhibiting suppletion, code 0.

In (169b) the sentence has been passivised. Note that the verb is now marked for passive voice by di-. The undergoer is now assigned pivot status and thus appears in pre-verbal position. The actor -nyo has been demoted to non-core status and is encoded as a post-verbal enclitic.\n\n(169) a. b.\n\nNyo nio manolong setiap urang.\n3 want AV-help ONE-every person\n‘He wants to help everyone.’\nSetiap urang nio ditolongnyo.\nONE-every person want PV-help-3\n‘Everyone wants to be helped by him.’\n(Elicitation)\n\nDitransitive verb roots also do not require an applicative to be passivised because the verb’s argument structure already specifies the appropriate number and type of arguments. For example, refer to (129c) and (129d) in which the ditransitive verb agiah, ‘give’, is passivised. Note that both the undergoer pitih, ‘money’, and the pronominal recipient inyo can be assigned pivot status. Ditransitive verbs can also be derived from transitive verb roots with the addition of an applicative.\n\nThe -an applicative allows for non-core benefactor arguments to be reassigned core argument status and thus makes them available to be selected as the pivot in a passive clause (see example (130e)). However, recipients (see example (235)) and instruments or comitative participants (see example (170)) must remain non-core arguments and may not be selected as the pivot even if an applicative is used. If they appear in preverbal position they must be marked by a preposition in order to disambiguate semantic roles.\n\n(170) a.\n\nCimangko tu\n\ndikuduangnyo jo pisau.\n\nwatermelon DEM:dist PV-cut-3\n\nwith knife\n\nUNDERGOER\n\nVERB-ACTOR NON-CORE\n\n‘He cut the watermelon with a knife.’\n\n139\n\n\fb.

Her analysis draws on Hopper and Thompson’s (1980) Transitivity Hypothesis, which works on the grounds that a clause can be assigned a level of transitivity on a continuum ranging from high to low transitivity. The level of transitivity is assigned according to the Transitivity Schema, which is presented in Table 3.\n\n3 A similar phenomenon also occurs in Colloquial Minangkabau (see Chapter 6). 25\n\n\fTable 3.

Each of these examples also has a pre-verbal participant whose semantic role is not revealed by the syntax of the clause. When the examples are taken out of context, the pre-verbal participants in each of the (a) sentences can be assigned either the actor or undergoer role without affecting the grammaticality of the clause. In fact, as the (b) and (c) sentences reveal, assigning the pre-verbal participant the undergoer role and marking the verb for passive voice produces a sentence equally as acceptable as assigning the participant the actor role and marking the verb for active voice.\n\n(260) a. b. c.\n\nTu\n\ngigik acek ndak Mbon?\n\nDEM:dist bite leech NEG TRU-Mambon\n\n‘It was bitten by a leech wasn’t it Mbon?’\n\n(Text ID: 837845093215200406)\n\nTu\n\ndigigik acek ndak Mbon?\n\nDEM:dist PV-bite leech NEG TRU-Mambon\n\n‘It was bitten by a leech wasn’t it Mbon?’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n#Tu\n\nmanggigik acek ndak\n\nDEM:dist AV-bite\n\nleech NEG\n\n‘It bit a leech didn’t it Mbon?’\n\nMbon?\nTRU-Mambon\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(261)a.\n\nTu\n\npisang karek-karek potong-potong.\n\nDEM:dist banana RED-chop RED-cut\n\n‘Then the banana is chopped up, cut up.’\n\n(Text ID: 346157221330230506)\n\n194\n\n\fb.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

Transitivising affixes (SM -i, -kan, BH -i, -akan, SWY -i, -ka(n)/-kə, IBN -ka, JKT -in; SM (məm)pər-, MIN (mam)pa-, BH (ta)pa-, IBN p(ə)-) and reflexes of PM *(mb)Ar- (> SM bər-, MIN, BH ba-, o.i. bə-) have already been treated in Adelaar (1984a); a short account of this treatment is given below in 6.1.1,6.1.2.\nVerbs can be either simple or derived. For instance, transitive verbs are either transitive sui generis or secondarily derived from nouns or other verbs. Derived transitive verbs are subject to some of the same morphological processes as primary verbal bases (the derivative\nVDIs and VSIs by testing their valency with the verb məfijadi ‘become’ is from Hein Steinhauer. Prentice and\nSteinhauer's criteria are tentative, and nave not yet been tested systematically. 181The definition of precategorials differs from one author to the other. For instance, Muhadjir's definition includes root morphemes with multiple-class membership, components of (partial or entire) reduplication that do\nnot occur in other environments (e.g. kure, grate and cdddt would be precategorial roots in the words kurikuri ‘turtle’, grakgrikgruk ‘sound like one who has a cough or a cold’, and eəeðɑdt ‘bat’), lexemes denoting a unit of money such as pdrak ‘rupiah’, and even loanwords deriving from prepositional phrases in the lending language (ef. alakadar ‘what is available (adv.)’ < AR cala qadr ‘commensurate with, corresponding to,\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nAcehnese has a system of pronominal marking on its verbs which cross-references the agent and undergoer arguments. Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nCHAPTER6\nPROTO MALAYIC AFFIXES\nIn this chapter some of the affixes that occur in the Malayic isolects are treated. Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nB. Before lexemes with initial vowel, the allomorphs so- or s- of the clitic sə- occur (sadenotes singularity, or the circumstance of belonging to the same category) occur, e.g.\n\naxt'day’: alus ‘fine, refined’: iku8?‘tail’: ixup ‘draught’: uxap {oxap in Helfrich) ‘person, human being’: umur ‘age’:\n\nsaxi ‘one day, per day’ soalus ‘as fine/refined as’ siku?7 ‘one tail; one piece per item’ soixup 'a draught, a pull’\nsuxap ‘someone, a person, per person’ soumur ‘(same) age; as old as’\n\nC. The intransitive verbal prefix bə- is realised:\n\n(1) as bo- before initial a, e.g.\n\nana?‘child’:\n\nboana7‘have children, give birth’\n\n(2) as bo- or bax- before initial i or u, e.g.\n\nisi ‘content(s)’: (ixis): (iŋgut): (uba(h)): umur ‘age’:\n\nboisi ‘contain’ boixis ‘(be) carved with’ baxipgut ‘move, stir’ baxuba(h) ‘change (v)’ boumur ‘having the age of, old, mature, last (v)’\n\nD. The prefix tə- (denoting involuntariness, or superlative degree) is realised:\n\n(1) as to- or tax- before initial a, e.g.\n\n(ambi97): alap ‘beautiful’: (apkat):\n\ntoambi97 ‘taken away’ toalap ‘very beautiful’ taxapkat ‘raised, lifted’\n\n(2) as tax- before initial i, e.g.\n\n(ipgut):\n\ntaxipgut ‘touched’\n\n(3) as t- before initial u, e.g.\n\n(untap):\n\ntuntap ‘bump up against’\n\n\f20\n\nE. The nominal circumfix kə- an (which forms nouns, Or verbs with the meaning ‘be affected by [base]’)is realised as follows:\n\n(1) as ko- an before a and i, e.g.\n\nadil ‘just’: alus ‘fine, refined’: idup ‘live, life’: ilu97 ‘beautiful, good’:\n\nkoadilan ‘justice’ koalusan ‘refinement’ koidupan ‘life, living’ koiiu7an ‘s.th. that can be improved, goodness’\n\n(2) as k- an before u, e.g.\n\nujan ‘rain’:\n\nkujanan ‘be caught in the rain’\n\nF. Before the clitics -no (referring to the third person as an object or, if the verb is patientoriented, to the third person as an agent) and -la(h) (emphatic particle), the transitive verbal suffix -ka is realised as -ko-, e.g.\n\ndiambi9?ka ‘taken away’:\n"

For these predicates, I argue that ba- functions to mark middle voice. These middle predicates are intransitive but it is clear that the actor also undergoes some change, so in this sense they are broadly reflexive. Middle voice in Minangkabau resembles the middle voice of Greek which is used to mark transitive predicates that are somewhere between an active and a passive, or intransitive predicates that have a passive like relation to their subject (Bakker, 1994). In fact, the reflexive and reciprocal predicates can also be described as middle constructions since the action does not extend beyond the sphere of the actor. According to Croft’s (1991; 1994) event-based framework for voice phenomena, reflexives and reciprocals have the same event frame as middle verbs since they involve a situation in which the subject is both the initiator and end point of the action.\n\nCross-linguistically, the middle voice is associated with a number of situation types that involve similar aktionsart and event properties. Based on Talmy’s (1972) classification of event types, Kemmer (1994: 181-83) lists ten middle situation types that might involve middle marking in languages that have a middle voice. Kemmer’s middle situation types are listed in Table 19.\n\n164\n\n\fTable 19.

For these predicates, I argue that ba- functions to mark middle voice. These middle predicates are intransitive but it is clear that the actor also undergoes some change, so in this sense they are broadly reflexive. Middle voice in Minangkabau resembles the middle voice of Greek which is used to mark transitive predicates that are somewhere between an active and a passive, or intransitive predicates that have a passive like relation to their subject (Bakker, 1994). In fact, the reflexive and reciprocal predicates can also be described as middle constructions since the action does not extend beyond the sphere of the actor. According to Croft’s (1991; 1994) event-based framework for voice phenomena, reflexives and reciprocals have the same event frame as middle verbs since they involve a situation in which the subject is both the initiator and end point of the action.\n\nCross-linguistically, the middle voice is associated with a number of situation types that involve similar aktionsart and event properties. Based on Talmy’s (1972) classification of event types, Kemmer (1994: 181-83) lists ten middle situation types that might involve middle marking in languages that have a middle voice. Kemmer’s middle situation types are listed in Table 19.\n\n164\n\n\fTable 19.

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-. There are, however, some important reasons not to reconstruct a prefix for this correspondence set:\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nnumber of languages (Kemmer, 1994) so it is not unusual for these forms to exist in Minangkabau.\n\n(211) (212)\n\nBanyak urang maabiahan pitih, ndak nyo bapikia dulu.\nmany person AV-finish-APP money NEG 3 RFLX-think before\n‘Many people spend money without thinking about it first.’\n(Elicitation)\nInyo basangko buruak.\n3 RFLX-suspect bad\n‘He suspects something bad.’\n(Elicitation)\n\nThe ba- prefix also functions to mark reciprocal predicates.

For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

The affix derives middle verbs from nouns as demonstrated in (59) and (60) (please also see Chapter 5).\n\n(59)\n\nBasuami jo urang Lampuang.\n\nMID-husband with person Lampung\n\n‘She married a man from Lampung.’\n\n(Text ID: 337497105305200306)\n\n(60)\n\nSi Emi basakolah, si Roni sagalo si Ann lai ado rumah.\n\nPERS Emi MID-school PERS Roni all\n\nPERS Ann more exist house\n\n‘Emi went to school, so did Roni, all of them did, but Ann stayed at home.’\n\n(Text ID: 562203133739080306)\n\nVerbal predicates can also be derived from nominals with the use of the active voice prefix maN-. For example, in (61) the verb mancarito-carito, ‘tell a story’, has been derived from the NP carito, ‘story,’ (see Section 6.3.1.3 for more examples of active verbs derived from nominals).\n\n(61)\n\nE ado mancarito-carito jo ambo.\n\nFILL exist AV-RED-story\n\nwith 1sg\n\n‘Somebody told me the story.’\n\n(Text ID: 157057083427161106)\n\nUnmarked nominals can be predicative even when a marked alternative exists. For example, in (62) notice that the unmarked form namo, ‘name’, functions predicatively in the same way as the marked form banamo.\n\n(62) a.\n\nNamo nyo Ana.\nname 3 Ana\n‘She is called Ana.’\n\n83\n\n\fb. Banamo nyo Ana.\nMID-name 3 Ana\n‘She is called Ana.’ (Elicitation)\n4.3.1.2 Numeral Predicates\nMinangkabau also has numeral predicates. Numeral predicates, like some nominal predicates, are attributive. In (63) the numeral head duo, ‘two’, modifies the argument anak den, ‘my children’.\n\n(63)\n\nAnak den duo.\n\nchild 1sg two\n\n‘I have two children .’\n\n[Literally: ‘my children are two in number.’]\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAlso like nominal predicates, numeral predicates can be preceded by TAM adverbials.

Notice that in this example the perfective marker alah precedes the predicate.\n\n(74)\n\nInyo alah di kantua.\n\n3 PFCT LOC office\n\n‘He's already at the office.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n4.3.2 Verbal Predicates\n\nThe prototypical predicate construction in Minangkabau has a verb as its head. Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

In (65a) ba- is affixed to duo to indicate that the pivot nyo is in a state of ‘twoness’. In (65a), the ba- affix forces the interpretation that the pivot nyo is a single entity consisting of two parts, these two parts performing the action together. Whereas in (65b), duo refers to two separate entities.\n\n(65) a.\n\nDatang nyo baduo.\ncome 3 MID-two\n‘They came together.’\n\n84\n\n\fb. Datang nyo duo.\ncome 3 two\n‘Two of them came.’\n(Elicitation)\nQuantifiers can also function as the head of a predicate construction and have the same attributive function. For example, in (66) the predicate is the quantifier banyak, ‘a lot’, which modifies the NP saudara ibu, ‘your brothers and sisters’, and in (67) the quantifier saketek, ‘a little bit’, functions as the head to modify the NP nasi, ‘rice’.\n\n(66)\n\nSaudara ibuk masih banyak?\n\nsibling mother still many\n\nDo you still have many brothers and sisters?\n\n(Text ID: 574966094643200306)\n\n(67)\n\nNasi\n\nsaketek.\n\ncooked.rice ONE-small\n\n‘There’s only a little bit of rice.’\n\n(Text ID: 833517024233300606)\n\n4.3.1.3 Existential Predicates\nExistential predicates are those which have the auxiliary verbs ado, ‘to be, to exist’, or punyo, ‘to have’, as their head.\nThe verb ado licenses a single nominal argument. In examples (68) and (69) ado is the head of the predicate construction and ujan, ‘rain’, and banyak samuik, ‘lot of ants’, are the respective arguments.\n\n(68)\n\nAdo ujan.\n\nexist rain\n\n‘It’s raining.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n85\n\n\f(69)\n\nAdo banyak samuik di tampek gulo.\n\nexist many ant\n\nLOC place sugar\n\n‘There are lots of ants in the sugar container.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4).

Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language.

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

Haspelmath (2016) states that \"a serial verb construction must be a productive schematic construction such that the meaning of a concrete construct can be determined on the basis of the meanings of its parts and the construction meaning.\" By contrast, verbal compounds, which are phonologically bound, are lexicalized and often non-compositional.\n\nGrambank distinguishes serial verb constructions from clause-chaining (see [GB150](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB150)). Clause chaining involves a series of verbs where only one verb is inflected. For a construction to be a serial verb construction, it must align with Haspelmath's definition and not constitute an instance of clause chaining (i.e., there is no single inflected verb while the other verbs are without inflection). Nevertheless, a language may feature both serial verb constructions and clause chaining.\n\nSerial verb constructions are also different from light verb constructions, which are made up of a verbal element and a lexical stem which is not an inflected verb, jointly determining argument structure (see [GB123](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB123)).  \n\nThe term 'verb' here refers to words that can function as independent verbs in the language under consideration. Ideally, these verbs should be dynamic, as per Haspelmath's (2016) definition: \"Verbs are defined as dynamic event expressions that do not have special coding when used in predication function\". Serial verb constructions that are more restricted, such as applying solely to stative verbs (e.g., a verb meaning 'to be good'), should not be counted as 1. Be cautious with descriptions using \"auxiliary verbs\" and \"copulas\" as these typically do not qualify as serial verb constructions.\n\n\n",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nCHAPTER6\nPROTO MALAYIC AFFIXES\nIn this chapter some of the affixes that occur in the Malayic isolects are treated. Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nExamples (231) to (234) demonstrated how -an derives transitive verbs from stative and active intransitive verbs roots. The resultant transitive verbs manyakikan, ‘hurt’, mamatian, ‘switch off’, mangumpuaan, ‘collect’, mangaluaan, ‘take out’, all have causative semantics (see Section 5.3.1.1). In terms of Croft’s (1994: 112-13) framework\n177\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\npossible events. Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft\n"

This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

This makes light verb constructions different from serial verb constructions and verbal compounding, which involve a sequence of more than one verb. Another difference is that there is a predicate-argument relationship between the light verb and the other lexical stem (e.g. in *do baby*, *baby* is the object of *do*), while in serial verb constructions the verbs do not have a predicate-argument relationship between them since they instead describe a sequence of events. \n\n",

First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nCHAPTER6\nPROTO MALAYIC AFFIXES\nIn this chapter some of the affixes that occur in the Malayic isolects are treated. Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nI confine myself here mainly to the study of living affixes, although I give a short discussion of the evidence from some fossilised affixes in 6.8.182 There are verbal and nominal affixes. Verbal affixes are derivational or inflectional (the latter are focus-markers); nominal affixes are derivational. Cliticised reflexes of *sa ? (> MIN, BH sa, o.i. sə-) are treated in 5.3.2; reflexes of the clitic *-ha (> SM, BH -na, MIN -no, -no, -o, -e, SWY -no, -o, JKT -nd) are treated in 5.5.1.3. Transitivising affixes (SM -i, -kan, BH -i, -akan, SWY -i, -ka(n)/-kə, IBN -ka, JKT -in; SM (məm)pər-, MIN (mam)pa-, BH (ta)pa-, IBN p(ə)-) and reflexes of PM *(mb)Ar- (> SM bər-, MIN, BH ba-, o.i. bə-) have already been treated in Adelaar (1984a); a short account of this treatment is given below in 6.1.1,6.1.2.\nVerbs can be either simple or derived. For instance, transitive verbs are either transitive sui generis or secondarily derived from nouns or other verbs. Derived transitive verbs are subject to some of the same morphological processes as primary verbal bases (the derivative\nVDIs and VSIs by testing their valency with the verb məfijadi ‘become’ is from Hein Steinhauer.

Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language.

The existential marker can be used for the expression of other functions, such as aspect, as long as it is **not** identical to the copula of identity or attribution (as is the case with *is*, *That book **is** part of a series.* and *That book **is** great*).

To illustrate this, consider example (70).

Like verbal predicates, locative predicates can also be modified by preceding adverbials, including negators and TAM adverbials.\n\nAn example of a locative predicate can be found in (73).

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nOne of the most interesting patterns of language use I observed in the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus was the high frequency of bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are unmarked for voice (see Chapter 6). This raised questions not only about the obligatoriness of voice marking but also how speakers are able to determine the semantic roles of the participants in the clause. Conducting elicitation was an essential stage in the process of understanding these bare verb forms because I was able to ask speakers about the restrictions on using these bare forms and also to test the productivity and use of these forms in syntactic and pragmatic contexts not found in the corpus.\n5 An Aqiqa is a Muslim ceremony in which a new born baby is named. 45\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n(64)\n\nAnak aden alah duo.\n\nchild 1sg PFCT duo\n\n‘I already have two children.’\n\n[Literally: ‘my children are already two in number.’]\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNumerals can also productively combine with the affix ba-. In (65a) ba- is affixed to duo to indicate that the pivot nyo is in a state of ‘twoness’. In (65a), the ba- affix forces the interpretation that the pivot nyo is a single entity consisting of two parts, these two parts performing the action together. Whereas in (65b), duo refers to two separate entities.\n\n(65) a.\n\nDatang nyo baduo.\ncome 3 MID-two\n‘They came together.’\n\n84\n\n\fb.

Bare verbs are used obligatorily in a number of constructions in the language. Stative verbs, imperatives and prohibitives must be unaffixed, as must be the main verb in a P2 construction. There are also a number of lexicalised bare active verbs in Minangkabau that cannot be marked for voice.\n\nAn example of a stative verb can be found in (246). In (246a) the inherent stative meaning of the verb root dingin, ‘cold’, is intended therefore the verb must be unaffixed. In (246b) the verb root is marked for active voice by the prefix maN-, this alters the inherent aktionsart of the root and derives a change of state verb (see Section 5.1.2.2).\n\n(246) a. b.\n\nUdaro ko\n\nair\n\nDEM:prox\n\n‘It’s cold.’\n\ndingin.\ncold\n\nMandingin se udaro ko\n\nyo.\n\nAV-cold\n\njust air\n\nDEM:prox EMPH\n\n‘It’s getting cold isn’t it.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nIn Minangkabau, imperative verbs obligatorily occur in the bare form (see Section 4.3.2.5). Example (247) demonstrates this fact with the verb tutuik, ‘shut’. Sentence (247a) is a basic transitive active construction and the verb root tutuik is marked for active voice by the maN- prefix. Sentence (247b) exemplifies the use of the verb in the imperative construction.

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

In these languages, a speaker could not simply say that something ‘is’ somewhere. Some posture verbs that may occur in languages are verbs for sitting, standing, hanging and lying.

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity.

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity.

Reciprocal verbs all belong to the category of semi-transitives because they usually also have co-constituents. Muhadjir's “semi-transitives” could be distinguished on the same terms for SM as for JKT: SM also has a class of verbs which can govern a complement which, however, cannot function as subject vis-a-vis these verbs (e.g. suka Tike (s.th. or s.o.)’, tahu ‘know (s.th.)’, bəlajar ‘study, learn (s.th.)’, bərbieara ‘speak (a language)’; these verbs do not require a preposition).

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nLOW TRANSITIVITY 1 participant non-action atelic non-punctual non-volitional negative irrealis A low in potency O not affected O non-individuated (e.g.: abstract, non-referential, mass, inanimate)\n\nThe Transitivity Schema works on a comparative scalar system so that not all criteria need to be satisfied in order for a clause to be transitive.

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

According to Langacker, nouns involve summary scanning; we need only to glance at an object summarily in order to tell what kind of object it is. Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way. He argues that verbs, on the other hand, involve change over time, therefore we supposedly perceive events in a sequential way; a snapshot view of a person mid-motion will not tell us if that person is standing, jumping, running, falling or involved in any number of other\n54",

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

For example, the objects in _I like **apples**_ (nominal object) and _I like **that you play the piano every morning**_ (clausal object) are in the same position (SVO). Many of the languages that do not place clausal objects in the same position as nominal objects are SOV languages that use SVO order for (long) clausal objects. This question aims to discern whether these clausal objects are treated like prototypical nominal direct objects (not indirect or obliques). This is not always explicitly stated by the descriptive work, but an investigation into the examples and perhaps even appended text of the grammar should typically reveals evidence for answering this question. \n\n",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class. However, this distinction is not captured by Chomsky’s (1970) classification framework.\n\n(22) a. John pounded the metal flat.\n\n(AP)\n\nb. John threw the ball into the barrel.

These cases indicate the importance of pragmatics for determining semantic roles and also raise questions about the importance of specifying semantic roles in the first place. These issues are discussed further in Section 6.2.\n198\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nTable 7. Langacker’s (1987b) conceptual categorisation of parts of speech.\n\nNOUN VERB ADJECTIVE\n\nRELATIONALITY + +\n\nSCANNING summary sequential summary\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) notion of ‘scanning’ refers to the perception of these entities (nouns, verbs and adjectives, i.e. objects, events, and qualities) over time. According to Langacker, nouns involve summary scanning; we need only to glance at an object summarily in order to tell what kind of object it is. Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way. He argues that verbs, on the other hand, involve change over time, therefore we supposedly perceive events in a sequential way; a snapshot view of a person mid-motion will not tell us if that person is standing, jumping, running, falling or involved in any number of other\n54\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nTable 6. Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].\n"

Nevertheless, the verb in (20a) is marked by the generalised active marker N- whereas the verb in (20b) is marked by the generalised patient marker di-. Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice. The sentences in (21) show two Riau Indonesian ‘neutral’ constructions in which the verb beli, ‘buy’, is unmarked.\n\n(21) a.\n\nBeli aku laser, kan.\nbuy 1sg laser Q\n‘I’ll buy a laser, right.’ [Context: Contemplating a shopping trip.]\n\n38\n\n\fb.

In (21a) notice that the verb is followed by the actor, the first person pronoun aku, and then the patient, laser, ‘ a laser’. However, in (21b) the verb is followed by the patient, nasi goreng, ‘fried rice’, and then the actor, aku.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nthe clause, only marking the verb for active voice would produce a grammatical sentence. Sentence (264b) shows the active voice reading. However, my consultants agreed that nyo could also refer to the actor. In this case, the sentence could also be rendered in passive voice, as (264c) shows. It could also be the case that cuci and masak in (263) and (264) are intentionally left bare so that the participants muko, ‘face’, and nyo, ‘it’, are potentially both actors and undergoers thus coercing a reflexive or middle interpretation of the event.\nFinally, since the verb caliak, ‘see’, in (265a) is not marked for voice, determining the semantic roles of the participants referred to by the pronouns den and -e is a difficult task if the sentence is taken out of context.\nBoth active and passive permutations of the sentence are possible as (265b) and (265c) demonstrate; in (265b) den is the actor and -e the undergoer, whereas in (265c) den is the undergoer and -e is the actor. However, my language consultants agreed that although the passive interpretation of the sentence presented in (265c) is plausible, the interpretation presented in (265b) is preferred. This is because the way the progression of events is encoded in (265c), i.e. the speaker laughing then being looked at by someone, is unusual. It is much more likely that if the event aden galak, ‘I laughed’, is a reason or cause for the speaker to be looked at, following principles of iconicity, it ought to come after the main verb caliak, ‘see’. So for a passive interpretation to be as available as an active one, the sentence ought to read den dicaliake ma (dek) aden galak, ‘he looked at me (because) I laughed’, instead.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nInterestingly, Davies’ (2005) study of Madurese, which is an Indonesian-type language spoken in Madura and East Java, suggests that the active and passive voice markers in this language are also used to encode a foregrounding/backgrounding distinction and are associated with an aspectual distinction. Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-. Foregrounding clauses were also more likely to be perfective, and backgrounding clauses to be imperfective. He argues then that e- and Nare associated with this aspectual distinction not categorically, but by virtue of their appearance in foregrounding and backgrounding clauses respectively.\n\nExamples (11) and (12) come from a recounting of the folk tale Bang Mera so Bang Pote, ‘Onion and Garlic’, which tells of the fate of two sisters named Onion and Garlic. In (11) we see an example of active voice used in a clause containing background information. In (12) we see use of the “object voice” in a foreground clause used to describe an “action that moves the story forward” (Davies, 2005: 213).\n\n(11)\n\nReng lake’ gelle’ ngrabadi Bang.Pote.\n\nperson male previous AV-care-APP Garlic\n\n‘The man took care of Garlic.’\n\n(Davies, 2005: 213)\n\n(12)\n\nSamper gelle’ etabang bi’ Bang.Pote.\n\ncloth\n\nprevious OV-search with Garlic\n\n‘Garlic searched for the cloth.’\n\n(Davies, 2005: 213)\n"

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes. Table 10 lists each of these formal properties of verbs and describes how these properties are realised in Minangkabau.\n67\n\n\fTable 10.

Central to the Aristotelian philosophy of language was the idea that the structure of language (i.e. the formal properties of language) reflected the structure of the world.\nAccording to Lyons (1968: 271), Aristotelian grammarians argued that “the physical world consists of things (‘substances’) which have certain properties (‘accidents’), initiate or undergo certain processes, stand in a certain relationship to one another, or have a certain extension or location in space and time”. In other words, a ‘substance’ is an individual entity in the real world that exists in abstraction from its ‘accidents’ (i.e. its properties of existence in space and time). This translates in grammatical terms to a distinction between a lexeme (which refers to some ‘substance’ in the real world) and its\n49",

These uncontrolled predicates may be found in specialized constructions, including different case frames (‘sleep hits me’), special conjugation classes of verbs or adjectives, dedicated (modal) markers for control vs. non-control, etc. Other terms that may be used in the literature are non-volitional, non-agentive, non-volitive or involuntary. Note that we are not interested in how stative events with *inanimate* experiencers are coded: their coding is irrelevant, whether they show distinctions with controlled events or states or not.

These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation.

Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action.

This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

Kroeger (1998) argues that the Kimaragang infix -in-, although used as a marker of past tense when combined with verbal roots, can also function as a nominaliser, combining not only with verbal roots but nominal and adjectival ones as well. Kroeger (1998) argues that the resultant nominalisations are lexically distinct from the past tense forms of the verbs and also have unpredictable semantics. Some examples of nominalisations based on verbal roots in Kimaragang can be found in (284). Note that the -in- infix results in a semantic narrowing of the root in the nominalised forms.\n215\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n(3) It seems that the function that must be attributed to *mAN(].')- is that of agent-oriented verb marker, since this is the function of its reflexes in the isolects. By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-. There are, however, some important reasons not to reconstruct a prefix for this correspondence set:\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nc.

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation. Yet, as examples (263), (264) and (265) show, even in ambiguous cases voice marking is not required.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nCHAPTER6\nPROTO MALAYIC AFFIXES\nIn this chapter some of the affixes that occur in the Malayic isolects are treated. Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).\n"

Clause chains may also be referred to as topic chains or as sequences of medial clauses/medial verbs. Crucially, this construction involves a single clause with a full, unrestricted, finite verb form and medial clauses that are dependent on it for specification of inflectional categories (e.g. TAM). \n\nClause chains are often used to describe sequences of events, and the medial verbs involved may be marked by [special affixes to indicate temporal relationships](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB152). Clause chains may also include markers of [switch reference](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB151). Medial verbs in some languages may be marked in the usual way for person/number of their arguments, though they generally lack some other canonical verbal inflection or involve specific marked verb forms that cannot be used in freestanding clauses. \n\nThere is considerable debate regarding the syntax of clause chaining generally and within individual languages. This construction is not merely a series of juxtaposed minimal clauses, as it requires dependency on one fully specified clause for full interpretation. It is also not straightforwardly a series of subordinated clauses (as in the series of temporal adjuncts in English, *Before he ate, while he was cooking the soup, he added salt.*). The syntactic relationship between clauses in clause chains is often described as a special type of coordination or a form of cosubordination.\n\nIn some cases clause-chaining may be difficult to distinguish from [serial verb constructions](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB118). Remember that a serial verb construction involves a set of verbs or verb phrases that function as a single predicate, whereas clause-chaining involves a set of *clauses* with formally reduced verbs, all dependent on a single fully specified verb form. Clause-chaining is also different from [verb compounding](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB122) in that the clauses in clause chaining are [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) and express separate propositions, which is not the case for verb compounding.

Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988).

For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nHowever, Durie (1985a: 180) does make a distinction between ‘Core Roles’ and ‘nonCore Roles’ in Acehnese. He argues that a Core Role is a participant licensed by the\n34\n\n\fverb’s argument structure that is syntactically ‘available’. Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988). An example of this construction can be found in (19).\n\n(19) a.\n\nGopnyan ka geu=côm lôn.\n\nshe\n\nalready 3-kiss\n\nI\n\n‘She (already) kissed me.’\n\nb. Lôn ka\n\ngeu=côm lé gopnyan.\n\nI already 3=kiss\n\nby she\n\n‘I’ve (already) been kissed by her.’\n\n(adapted from Lawler, 1977: 225)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nAcehnese has a system of pronominal marking on its verbs which cross-references the agent and undergoer arguments. Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nOf all the kinds of clauses with bare verb stems, the most interesting are those cases where the intended semantic roles of the participants are most ambiguous. These cases indicate the importance of pragmatics for determining semantic roles and also raise questions about the importance of specifying semantic roles in the first place. These issues are discussed further in Section 6.2.\n198\n"

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Verbal affixes are derivational or inflectional (the latter are focus-markers); nominal affixes are derivational. Cliticised reflexes of *sa ? (> MIN, BH sa, o.i. sə-) are treated in 5.3.2; reflexes of the clitic *-ha (> SM, BH -na, MIN -no, -no, -o, -e, SWY -no, -o, JKT -nd) are treated in 5.5.1.3. Transitivising affixes (SM -i, -kan, BH -i, -akan, SWY -i, -ka(n)/-kə, IBN -ka, JKT -in; SM (məm)pər-, MIN (mam)pa-, BH (ta)pa-, IBN p(ə)-) and reflexes of PM *(mb)Ar- (> SM bər-, MIN, BH ba-, o.i. bə-) have already been treated in Adelaar (1984a); a short account of this treatment is given below in 6.1.1,6.1.2.\nVerbs can be either simple or derived. For instance, transitive verbs are either transitive sui generis or secondarily derived from nouns or other verbs. Derived transitive verbs are subject to some of the same morphological processes as primary verbal bases (the derivative\nVDIs and VSIs by testing their valency with the verb məfijadi ‘become’ is from Hein Steinhauer. Prentice and\nSteinhauer's criteria are tentative, and nave not yet been tested systematically. 181The definition of precategorials differs from one author to the other. For instance, Muhadjir's definition includes root morphemes with multiple-class membership, components of (partial or entire) reduplication that do\nnot occur in other environments (e.g. kure, grate and cdddt would be precategorial roots in the words kurikuri ‘turtle’, grakgrikgruk ‘sound like one who has a cough or a cold’, and eəeðɑdt ‘bat’), lexemes denoting a unit of money such as pdrak ‘rupiah’, and even loanwords deriving from prepositional phrases in the lending language (ef. alakadar ‘what is available (adv.)’ < AR cala qadr ‘commensurate with, corresponding to,\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nPa- may co-occur with either the active voice marker maN- or the passive voice marker di- and is prefixed to the root prior to maN- prefixation or di- cliticisation. The prefix can also affix to an applicative-marked verb. When the verb root is active then both paand the applicative are required, for example in the verb ‘to teach’, mampalajari requires both pa- and the applicative -i. However, in causative verbs derived from stative stems, there is no significant shift in meaning if a verb is marked by both the\n156\n\n\fcausative prefix and an applicative, or just the causative prefix, or just an applicative (see examples (201) and (202)).\n\nThe causative prefix pa- functions productively to create causative verbs from stative stems but its effects on active stems are often unpredictable and idiomatic. Let us first examine some examples of causatives derived from stative verb roots before discussing some of the idiomatic effects of pa-.\n\nExamples (201) and (202) show how causative verbs are derived from stative verb roots. In (201) the causative verbs mampapanjang, mamanjangan, and mampapajangan, which all mean ‘lengthen’ (or literally ‘cause to become long’), are derived from the same stative root panjang, ‘long’. Notice that the causative verb can be derived using the causative prefix pa- as in (201a), the applicative -an as in (201b), or both the causative prefix and the applicative marker as in (201c).\n\n(201) a. b. c.\n\nPamarintah daerah nio mampapanjang jalan\n\nNOM-order area\n\nwant AV-CST-long road\n\n‘The local government will lengthen the bypass.’\n\nbypass.\nbypass\n\nPamarintah daerah nio mamanjangan jalan\n\nNOM-order area\n\nwant AV-long-APP road\n\n‘The local government will lengthen the bypass.’\n\nbypass.\nbypass\n\nPamarintah daerah nio mampapanjangan jalan bypass.\nNOM-order area want AV-CST-long-APP road bypass\n‘The local government will lengthen the bypass.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nB. Before lexemes with initial vowel, the allomorphs so- or s- of the clitic sə- occur (sadenotes singularity, or the circumstance of belonging to the same category) occur, e.g.\n\naxt'day’: alus ‘fine, refined’: iku8?‘tail’: ixup ‘draught’: uxap {oxap in Helfrich) ‘person, human being’: umur ‘age’:\n\nsaxi ‘one day, per day’ soalus ‘as fine/refined as’ siku?7 ‘one tail; one piece per item’ soixup 'a draught, a pull’\nsuxap ‘someone, a person, per person’ soumur ‘(same) age; as old as’\n\nC. The intransitive verbal prefix bə- is realised:\n\n(1) as bo- before initial a, e.g.\n\nana?‘child’:\n\nboana7‘have children, give birth’\n\n(2) as bo- or bax- before initial i or u, e.g.\n\nisi ‘content(s)’: (ixis): (iŋgut): (uba(h)): umur ‘age’:\n\nboisi ‘contain’ boixis ‘(be) carved with’ baxipgut ‘move, stir’ baxuba(h) ‘change (v)’ boumur ‘having the age of, old, mature, last (v)’\n\nD. The prefix tə- (denoting involuntariness, or superlative degree) is realised:\n\n(1) as to- or tax- before initial a, e.g.\n\n(ambi97): alap ‘beautiful’: (apkat):\n\ntoambi97 ‘taken away’ toalap ‘very beautiful’ taxapkat ‘raised, lifted’\n\n(2) as tax- before initial i, e.g.\n\n(ipgut):\n\ntaxipgut ‘touched’\n\n(3) as t- before initial u, e.g.\n\n(untap):\n\ntuntap ‘bump up against’\n\n\f20\n\nE. The nominal circumfix kə- an (which forms nouns, Or verbs with the meaning ‘be affected by [base]’)is realised as follows:\n\n(1) as ko- an before a and i, e.g.\n\nadil ‘just’: alus ‘fine, refined’: idup ‘live, life’: ilu97 ‘beautiful, good’:\n\nkoadilan ‘justice’ koalusan ‘refinement’ koidupan ‘life, living’ koiiu7an ‘s.th. that can be improved, goodness’\n\n(2) as k- an before u, e.g.\n\nujan ‘rain’:\n\nkujanan ‘be caught in the rain’\n\nF. Before the clitics -no (referring to the third person as an object or, if the verb is patientoriented, to the third person as an agent) and -la(h) (emphatic particle), the transitive verbal suffix -ka is realised as -ko-, e.g.\n\ndiambi9?ka ‘taken away’:\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nAcehnese has a system of pronominal marking on its verbs which cross-references the agent and undergoer arguments. Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.\n"

According to Langacker, nouns involve summary scanning; we need only to glance at an object summarily in order to tell what kind of object it is. Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way. He argues that verbs, on the other hand, involve change over time, therefore we supposedly perceive events in a sequential way; a snapshot view of a person mid-motion will not tell us if that person is standing, jumping, running, falling or involved in any number of other\n54",

Inherent properties of nouns:\n\nNumber\n\n• Nouns are modified for number but this is not\n\nmorphologically marked.\n\n• Noun roots are reduplicated to show plurality (in contrast to verb roots which are reduplicated to encode aspectual notions).\n\nGender/Classifiers Diminutives Definiteness/deictic status\n\n• There is a singular/plural distinction encoded in pronouns.\n• Numerical classifiers are used when counting but they are not morphologically marked.\n• There are no diminutive forming processes in Minangkabau.\n• Demonstratives are used to show the deictic status of nouns.\n\n2. Relational properties of nouns: Case/grammatical relations •\n\nBenefactive, instrumental, comitative, recipient and location non-core arguments are marked by specific prepositions.\n\nPossession\n\n• There is no marking of core grammatical relations on nouns; pivot and non-pivot arguments are determined by verbal marking, referential status and word order.\n• Possession is not morphologically marked on nouns.\n\n3. Agreement properties of nouns:\n\nPossessive structures\n\n• Possessive structures such as alienable/inalienable\n\npossession do not exist in Minangkabau.\n\nFrom Table 9 it is evident that Minangkabau nouns exhibit a number of the formal properties of nouns described by Anderson (1985), although none of these are morphologically marked except plurality. Noun plurals are created by reduplicating the substantive word (although a single non-reduplicated noun root can also be interpreted as plural if the context requires it). Example (23) shows how the noun root sanak, ‘sibling’, is reduplicated to indicate plurality.\n\n60\n\n\f(23)\n\nSanak-sank den.\n\nRED-sibling 1sg\n\n‘My siblings.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n4.1.3.1 Langacker\nLangacker (1987a; 1987b) argues that nouns, verbs and adjectives are distinct categories and that these categories can be defined according to the general cognitive, conceptual and semantic principles ‘relationality’ and ‘scanning’. These principles unite the functions of these parts of speech categories cross-linguistically. Langacker’s view\n53\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nTable 7.

According to Langacker, nouns involve summary scanning; we need only to glance at an object summarily in order to tell what kind of object it is. Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way. He argues that verbs, on the other hand, involve change over time, therefore we supposedly perceive events in a sequential way; a snapshot view of a person mid-motion will not tell us if that person is standing, jumping, running, falling or involved in any number of other\n54\n"

Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison.

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-. There are, however, some important reasons not to reconstruct a prefix for this correspondence set:\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nand *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT. Solution (4) yields more perspectives, because it fits in with the fact that JKT -an(l) also seems to be borrowed. Furthermore, JKT has only two suffixes (-in and -an( 1,2)) of which one, -in, is not inherited in any case and has replaced an earlier *-i (cf. 6.1.1). It is quite possible that at an earlier stage JKT lost all PM suffixes, and that JKT -an(l,2) is also innovative. But then again, if JKT -an(2) (forming nouns denoting goal or result on the basis of VTRs) is a loan morpheme, this time its source must be a Malayic isolect on account of its vowel (and not Balinese, as with -in, or JV, SUN, or Balinese, as with other forms of -an).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nThe third piece of evidence provided by Kroeger (1998) counters Foley’s (1998) claims that there are no unique nominalising processes in Philippine-type languages.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

            "summary": "Logophoric pronouns are used to distinguish reference to an individual whose speech or thought or feeling is being reported, as opposed to other third-person referents. Unsurprisingly, then, logophoric pronouns are found in reported speech contexts. This question concerns the existence of a special pronoun that specifically refers to the speaker/thinker/feeler in a reported speech construction. This special pronominal form occurs commonly in the complement clause of a speech or thought verb to designate the speaker/thinker/feeler (who is often also the subject of the speech/thought verb) as its referent.\n\n",

And if this pronoun has a different form than the third person personal and reflexive pronouns, then code 1.\n3. If the logophoric pronoun meets the criteria in (1) and (2) above, but is derived from another pronoun, code 1.\n4. If there is no difference in the pro-form used when the referent in a reported speech clause is the individual whose speech is reported vs. a different individual, code 0.\n\n",
            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n5.5.2.2 LOCATIVE PRONOUNS\nIn all isolects, locative pronouns are derived from demonstratives. In IBN this happened through prefixation of di-, and in the other isolects through prefixation of s-; in SM locative pronouns are usually precliticised by a locative preposition (viz. di ‘in, at’, kə ‘to(wards)’, and dari ‘from’). This leads to the following reconstructions:\n*(?)-(i)ni(?) ‘here’; ^l)-(i)tu(f) ‘there’; *(?)-(i)na(n) / *(?)-(a)na(?) ‘yonder’.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nAcehnese has a system of pronominal marking on its verbs which cross-references the agent and undergoer arguments. Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nBeu=neu=ingat keu lôn.\nHORT=2=remember to I\n‘Remember me!’\n\nb. Gopnyan ka h’an teu=ingat=geuh keu lôn.\n\nhe\n\nalready not DC=remember=3 to I\n\n‘He does not (cannot) remember me.’\n\n(Durie, 1985b: 49)\n\nIn (18a), notice that the verb ingat, ‘remember’, is marked by the second person agent proclitic neu, which is coreferential with the addressee. This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences.

The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class. However, this distinction is not captured by Chomsky’s (1970) classification framework.\n\n(22) a. John pounded the metal flat.\n\n(AP)\n\nb. John threw the ball into the barrel.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nQuestions about categorisation have also been asked about a number of Austronesian languages related to Minangkabau. Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nTable 6. Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].\n"

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words.

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

They can agree in number with the head noun even if the head noun is not overtly marked for number.

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb. In (51c) the prefixation of the active voice marker maN- creates a change of state verb from the root word and in (51d) the addition of the applicative –an derives a transitive, causative verb.\n\n(51) a.\n\nBaju itame tu\n\nnan gaek-gaek tu.\n\nshirt black-3 DEM:dist REL RED-old DEM:dist\n\n‘The old people wear black shirts.’\n\n(Text ID: 445038115055260406)\n73\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nTable 9. Formal properties of nouns in Minangkabau.\n\n(adapted from Anderson, 1985)\n\nFORMAL PROPERTIES OF\n\nHOW THESE PROPERTIES ARE REALISED IN MINANGKABAU\n\nNOUNS\n\n1. Inherent properties of nouns:\n\nNumber\n\n• Nouns are modified for number but this is not\n\nmorphologically marked.\n\n• Noun roots are reduplicated to show plurality (in contrast to verb roots which are reduplicated to encode aspectual notions).\n\nGender/Classifiers Diminutives Definiteness/deictic status\n\n• There is a singular/plural distinction encoded in pronouns.\n• Numerical classifiers are used when counting but they are not morphologically marked.\n• There are no diminutive forming processes in Minangkabau.\n• Demonstratives are used to show the deictic status of nouns.\n\n2. Relational properties of nouns: Case/grammatical relations •\n\nBenefactive, instrumental, comitative, recipient and location non-core arguments are marked by specific prepositions.\n\nPossession\n\n• There is no marking of core grammatical relations on nouns; pivot and non-pivot arguments are determined by verbal marking, referential status and word order.\n• Possession is not morphologically marked on nouns.\n\n3. Agreement properties of nouns:\n\nPossessive structures\n\n• Possessive structures such as alienable/inalienable\n\npossession do not exist in Minangkabau.\n\nFrom Table 9 it is evident that Minangkabau nouns exhibit a number of the formal properties of nouns described by Anderson (1985), although none of these are morphologically marked except plurality. Noun plurals are created by reduplicating the substantive word (although a single non-reduplicated noun root can also be interpreted as plural if the context requires it). Example (23) shows how the noun root sanak, ‘sibling’, is reduplicated to indicate plurality.\n\n60\n\n\f(23)\n\nSanak-sank den.\n\nRED-sibling 1sg\n\n‘My siblings.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nThree TAM adverbials, nio, alah and alun, are exemplified in examples (46), (47) and (48) respectively. Notice that the TAM markers precede the verb in all examples.\n\n(46)\n\nInyo duduak karano nio makan.\n\n3 sit\n\nbecause want eat\n\n‘He sat down because he wanted to eat.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(47)\n\nAlah dipotongnyo cimangko?\n\nPFCT PV-cut-3\n\nwatermelon\n\n‘Has the watermelon been cut up yet?’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(48)\n\nAlun ujan ari ko.\n\nnot.yet rain day DEM:dist\n\n‘It hasn’t rained yet today.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n70\n\n\fAccording to Anderson (1985), aktionsart can also be a formal or semantic property of verbs. In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nagreement categories or possessive structures such an alienable/inalienable possession distinction common in Oceanic languages (cf. Crowley, 2002), nor does it have regular diminutive forming processes.\n\nSome examples of these formal properties of Minangkabau nouns follow in examples (27) to (35). Example (27) shows number marking, examples (28) and (29) show how numerical classifiers work, examples (30), (31) and (32) show how possession is marked, example (33) shows how nouns can also be modified by attributive nouns, and examples (34) and (35) show the use of demonstratives.\n\nExample (27) shows a Minangkabau noun that is marked for number. Number is not morphologically marked in Minangkabau, instead numerals precede the noun. Example (27) illustrates this; the noun taun, year, is preceded by the numeral tigo.\n\n(27)\n\nLai tigo taun lebih kurang.\n\nmore three year more less\n\n‘More or less three years ago.’\n\n(Text ID: 979548152848070306)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also marked by numerical classifiers. Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)\n"

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison.

The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nTable 6. Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\naccounts for languages that appear to have no noun and verb distinction by suggesting that the roots themselves may not be category-specific. He further explains that the roots must take on nominal or verbal properties according to the construction in which they are used. He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7. Langacker’s (1987b) conceptual categorisation of parts of speech.\n\nNOUN VERB ADJECTIVE\n\nRELATIONALITY + +\n\nSCANNING summary sequential summary\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nthus equating them with adjectives, or do we negate both the operators, describing them as [-noun, -verb] and leaving no way of distinguishing them from adpositions? What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker\n"

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure.

It may be borrowed from Old Javanese, which has marika, an emphatic article which apparently also functioned as a*\nvery likely, but the connection of b- with +(a)ba is too conjectural.

Compare anak-da or ana-nda, ibu-nda, bapa-nda, cucu-nda, etc. As cliticised pronominal forms were already attested for PMP (Blust 1977a: 11), it is likely that PM had them as well, and that -ma:mu, -ta, and -(n)da are reflexes of these clitics. But it is not clear whether -ma:mu already occurred in PM as a suffix in its present shape or whether it was a complex form which developed into a single suffix after PM. Nor is it clear if the semantic shifts shown in -ta and -(n)da took place before or after PM. I reconstruct PM *-(ma)mu(?), *-ta 7 and *-(n)da 7, to which I tentatively attribute the meanings ‘(2nd pers. pl.)’, ‘(1st pers. pl. incl.)’, and ‘(3rd pers. pl.)’ because of their formal agreement with *kamu( 7), *kita 7and *sida ?respectively.\n\nTable 11: the reconstructed personal pronouns\n\nsingular\n\n(clitic)\n\nplural\n\n(clitic)\n\n1st person\n\n*aku\n\n*-ku, *ku-\n\n*kita7 (incl.)\n\n*-ta?\n\n*kami (excl.)\n\n2nd person\n\n*kau(?)\n\n*-mu(7)\n\n*kamu(7)\n\n*-mu/ *-(ma)mu(7)\n\n3rd person\n\n*ia\n\n*-na\n\n*sida?\n\n*-(n)da7\n\n5.5.2 Other pronouns\n\ndemonstrative (this) (that) (yonder)\n\nSM\nini itu nu(n)\n\nlocative (here) (there) (yonder)\n\n-sini -situ -sana\n\nrelative\n\nyag\n\nMIN iko/ko itu/tu\nsiko situ sinan na(N)\n\nBH\n\nSWY",

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nIn many AN languages there is an ongoing process of replacement by plural personal pronouns of singular ones that were felt to be too familiar, too impolite and/or too direct. It is quite possible that already in PM distinctions like polite versus familiar played a crucial role. However, a singuɪar/pɪuraɪ distinction is reconstructed for PM because it also apparently existed in PMP, and because the PMP plural personal pronouns are reflected in the isolects with retention of their plural meaning (viz. all isolects except JKT reflect PMP *(i)kita, and PMP *(i)kami, Classical Malay and SWY reflect PMP *(i)kamu, and IBN reflects PMP *si-iDa, all with retention of the plural notion).\n\n(2) In Classical Malay there occurs a series of personal pronouns viz. daku, dikaw, and dia, which is a variant of the series aku, əŋkaw and ia (dia is still a very frequent variant of ia).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n5.5.1.3 THIRD PERSON\nFor the third person SM and JKT have variant forms (SM dia/ia, JKT die/i?) of which one member agrees with IBN ia, and the other with SWY dio. SWY dio, JKT die may originally have had a distribution parallel to that of SM dia; it is also possible that they were borrowed from SM. The MIN and BH forms are problematic: they may have have developed from a morphologically complex pre-PM form *i-ni-ia, or from a (post-?) PM combination *ia + *na with contraction of *ia to i (or to a in MIN ano/ano; pronouns are often subject to irregular shortening and contraction), cf. SM diana ‘(3rd pers. sg./pl.)’ (Gerth van Wijk p.221; Klinkert). *ia was reconstructed for the third person singular (3.4.2.6), which is also in agreement with PMP *si-ia (Blust 1977a: 11).\nA cliticised form of the third person is SM, BH -na, MIN -no/-no/-o/-e; in IBN the full form is used. SM, MIN, BH, SWY, and JKT reflect *-na; the PMP ancestral form of *-na is *ni-a (Blust 1977a:10-l 1) in which a merger of the alveolar nasal with following *i into a palatal nasal had not yet taken place. Some isolects have a third person plural pronoun. One of these, IBN sida?, reflects PMP *si-iDa (Blust 1977a: 11), and PM *sida ? is reconstructed.\nThe other pronouns are later developments: SM məreka (itu)/marika (itu) does not occur in early Classical Malay texts, nor does it have correspondences in other isolects that are not felt to be originally SM. Marika is described as ‘a people’ in Howison (1801) and as ‘people, persons; an armour-bearer, esquire’ in Marsden (1812). It may be borrowed from Old Javanese, which has marika, an emphatic article which apparently also functioned as a*\nvery likely, but the connection of b- with +(a)ba is too conjectural. Beta and beita may be analysed as a derivation from an (unidentified) element *bA + *ita.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n5.5.2.2 LOCATIVE PRONOUNS\nIn all isolects, locative pronouns are derived from demonstratives. In IBN this happened through prefixation of di-, and in the other isolects through prefixation of s-; in SM locative pronouns are usually precliticised by a locative preposition (viz. di ‘in, at’, kə ‘to(wards)’, and dari ‘from’). This leads to the following reconstructions:\n*(?)-(i)ni(?) ‘here’; ^l)-(i)tu(f) ‘there’; *(?)-(i)na(n) / *(?)-(a)na(?) ‘yonder’.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n126\n\nthird person pronoun.173 BH bubuhanna (with epenthetic h?) ‘they; her/his group, family’ is derived from bubu ‘group, family’ (Durdje & Djantera 1978:43; Abdul Jebar 1977).\n\nN.B. OM has three other postcliticised personal pronouns. According to De Casparis -ma:mu is a second person possessive pronoun (De Casparis 1956:35), -ta is “probably a second person polite form” (p.21), and -da (/-nda after vowels) is “a honorific equivalent of na” (p.3).

In (65a) ba- is affixed to duo to indicate that the pivot nyo is in a state of ‘twoness’. In (65a), the ba- affix forces the interpretation that the pivot nyo is a single entity consisting of two parts, these two parts performing the action together. Whereas in (65b), duo refers to two separate entities.\n\n(65) a.\n\nDatang nyo baduo.\ncome 3 MID-two\n‘They came together.’\n\n84\n\n\fb. Datang nyo duo.\ncome 3 two\n‘Two of them came.’\n(Elicitation)\nQuantifiers can also function as the head of a predicate construction and have the same attributive function. For example, in (66) the predicate is the quantifier banyak, ‘a lot’, which modifies the NP saudara ibu, ‘your brothers and sisters’, and in (67) the quantifier saketek, ‘a little bit’, functions as the head to modify the NP nasi, ‘rice’.\n\n(66)\n\nSaudara ibuk masih banyak?\n\nsibling mother still many\n\nDo you still have many brothers and sisters?\n\n(Text ID: 574966094643200306)\n\n(67)\n\nNasi\n\nsaketek.\n\ncooked.rice ONE-small\n\n‘There’s only a little bit of rice.’\n\n(Text ID: 833517024233300606)\n\n4.3.1.3 Existential Predicates\nExistential predicates are those which have the auxiliary verbs ado, ‘to be, to exist’, or punyo, ‘to have’, as their head.\nThe verb ado licenses a single nominal argument. In examples (68) and (69) ado is the head of the predicate construction and ujan, ‘rain’, and banyak samuik, ‘lot of ants’, are the respective arguments.\n\n(68)\n\nAdo ujan.\n\nexist rain\n\n‘It’s raining.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n85\n\n\f(69)\n\nAdo banyak samuik di tampek gulo.\n\nexist many ant\n\nLOC place sugar\n\n‘There are lots of ants in the sugar container.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

We are not looking at noun classifiers ([GB057](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB057)) (classifiers classify the noun and occur independently from other elements). This feature asks whether adnominal numerals show agreement with the gender of nouns they modify. This system of agreement should be [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity).\n\nIf only the numeral \"one\" shows this agreement, that is sufficient.\n\n",

Code 0 if there is evidence of a gender/noun class system but the author states that the system is no longer productive in the context of adnominal numerals.\n4.

            "summary": "GB203 is concerned with the ordering of a universal quantifier (‘all’) and the noun. This feature has also been split into two binary features, \"GB203a Is the order of the adnominal collective universal quantifier (UQ) and noun UQ-N?\" and \"GB203b Is the order of the adnominal collective universal quantifier (UQ) and noun N-QU?\". It is possible to answer 1 or 0 for one of the binarised features, and \"?\" for the other. It is possible that there is no adnominal collective universal quantifier, in which case GB203, GB203a and GB203b are all 0 (see procedure).\n\nAs with other word order features in this database, this is focused specifically on adnominal quantification in pragmatically unmarked contexts. In languages that do not have a distinction between collective and distributive universal quantifiers (‘all’ vs. ‘every’), a quantifier that could be translated as ‘all’ and has a primarily plural use will be a sufficient target for this feature.\n\nThere are four possible codes for this feature, reflecting the fact that the collective universal quantifier might occur strictly before or strictly after the noun, may be allowed in both of these relative positions, or may not be present in a language. A 0 code is also applicable when the language does not allow a basic construction with an adnominal collective universal quantifier and a noun (e.g. if only a floating construction is used).\n\nOrders that result from constructions like quantifier float (e.g. English *The children have **all** come.*) should be disregarded for the purposes of coding this feature. \n\n",

If the collective universal quantifier or equivalent can occur either before or after the noun (UQ-N *or* N-UQ) in non-quantifier float constructions, code 3 for GB203 or 1 for GB203a and GB203b.\n4. If there is no collective universal quantifier or other universal quantifier that can be translated as ‘all’ and be used in an adnominal construction, code 0 for GB203 or GB203a and GB203b.\n5.

The intransitive verbal prefix bə- is realised:\n\n(1) as bo- before initial a, e.g.\n\nana?‘child’:\n\nboana7‘have children, give birth’\n\n(2) as bo- or bax- before initial i or u, e.g.\n\nisi ‘content(s)’: (ixis): (iŋgut): (uba(h)): umur ‘age’:\n\nboisi ‘contain’ boixis ‘(be) carved with’ baxipgut ‘move, stir’ baxuba(h) ‘change (v)’ boumur ‘having the age of, old, mature, last (v)’\n\nD. The prefix tə- (denoting involuntariness, or superlative degree) is realised:\n\n(1) as to- or tax- before initial a, e.g.\n\n(ambi97): alap ‘beautiful’: (apkat):\n\ntoambi97 ‘taken away’ toalap ‘very beautiful’ taxapkat ‘raised, lifted’\n\n(2) as tax- before initial i, e.g.\n\n(ipgut):\n\ntaxipgut ‘touched’\n\n(3) as t- before initial u, e.g.\n\n(untap):\n\ntuntap ‘bump up against’\n\n\f20\n\nE. The nominal circumfix kə- an (which forms nouns, Or verbs with the meaning ‘be affected by [base]’)is realised as follows:\n\n(1) as ko- an before a and i, e.g.\n\nadil ‘just’: alus ‘fine, refined’: idup ‘live, life’: ilu97 ‘beautiful, good’:\n\nkoadilan ‘justice’ koalusan ‘refinement’ koidupan ‘life, living’ koiiu7an ‘s.th. that can be improved, goodness’\n\n(2) as k- an before u, e.g.\n\nujan ‘rain’:\n\nkujanan ‘be caught in the rain’\n\nF. Before the clitics -no (referring to the third person as an object or, if the verb is patientoriented, to the third person as an agent) and -la(h) (emphatic particle), the transitive verbal suffix -ka is realised as -ko-, e.g.\n\ndiambi9?ka ‘taken away’:\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/reibaud_minangkabau2004_o.txt'}\nA.

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

Because the applicative has not been used, most speakers of Standard Minangkabau would label this example ungrammatical and prefer the verb mambaoan instead.

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2).

For this feature, we are looking for a verb that expresses predicative possession where the possessor is the subject, the possessum the object and the verb is finite and clearly transitive. The finite element in itself need not be clearly distinct from an existential or locational predicator, the main difference is the argument structure. \n\nTransitivity is a language-specific category that needs to be investigated separately to learn whether or not the construction is transitive. In case of languages where transitivity is hard to define it might be beneficial to compare to verbs of holding and grasping. It is very likely that habeo-verb constructions arise from possessive constructions where the possessor is expressed as a topic.\n\n",

Ambo maagiahan inyo pitih.\n1sg AV-give-APP 3 money\n‘I gave that guy money.’ (Elicitation)\nAnother feature of ditransitive verbs is that the recipient argument can be assigned core argument status and swap places with the undergoer argument. For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nFor example, in (237) we see that a ‘dative’ construction is possible without the use of the applicative. The verb mambao, ‘bring’, is transitive. In this example it is interpreted as ditransitive. The recipient participant den, ‘me’, appears in core argument position even though an applicative has not been used to license a recipient participant. Because the applicative has not been used, most speakers of Standard Minangkabau would label this example ungrammatical and prefer the verb mambaoan instead. However, the existence of this example shows that the applicative is not always required to create a ‘dative’ construction in Colloquial Minangkabau.\n175\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n(73)\n\nInyo alun ka rumah den.\n\n3\n\nnot.yet to house 1sg\n\n‘He hasn't been to my house yet.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAnother example can be found in (74) where the locative phrase di kantua, ‘at the office’, functions as the head. Notice that in this example the perfective marker alah precedes the predicate.\n\n(74)\n\nInyo alah di kantua.\n\n3 PFCT LOC office\n\n‘He's already at the office.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n4.3.2 Verbal Predicates\n\nThe prototypical predicate construction in Minangkabau has a verb as its head. Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives.

Instead, the verb punyo, ‘have’, is used to show a possessive relationship between the possessor and the possessed (see example (30)). Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo.

In (52) the noun tanaman, ‘plant’, is derived from the verb root tanam, ‘to plant’, in combination with the nominalising affix -an. The noun parampok, ‘thief’, in (53) makes use of the agentive nominaliser pa- to derive the form from the verb root rampok, ‘rob, steal’.

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech.

The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n(28)\n\nAdo yo lauake saikua\n\nnampak tadi ma.\n\nexist yes fish-3 ONE-CLASS:tail visible before EMPH\n\n‘There was a fish here before.’\n\n(Text ID: 707279021818220506)\n\n(29)\n\nInyo nio bali bara inceknyo?\n\n3\n\nwant buy how.many CLASS:seed-3\n\n‘How many of them does he want to buy?’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nIn many languages, possession is marked morphologically on the noun and languages with case systems tend to encode possession as genitive case marking. In Minangkabau, possession is not morphologically marked on the noun. Instead, the verb punyo, ‘have’, is used to show a possessive relationship between the possessor and the possessed (see example (30)). Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo. Similarly in (32), mainan, ‘toy’, is marked for possession by NP anak tu, ‘the child’.\n\n(30)\n\nPunyo den ma.\n\nhave 1sg EMPH\n\n‘It’s mine.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(31) (32)\n\nInyo manyikek abuaknyo.\n3 AV-brush hair-3\n‘She brushed her hair.’\n(Elicitation)\nMainan anak tu.\nplay-NOM child DEM:dist\n‘The child’s toy.’\n(Elicitation)\n\nIt is important to note that the constructions in (31) and (32) cannot be described exclusively as genitive constructions. Gil (2000: 192) argues that similar constructions\n63\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nFinally, since the question of precategoriality has been raised by the fact that unmarked nouns can function predicatively in Minangkabau (see Section 4.3.1.1), it is necessary to establish whether verbs can function to refer, as nouns prototypically do. The answer is that verbs can function referentially but that they are morphologically marked when\n\n74\n\n\fthey do so. This would indicate that predication really is an inherent, prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that reference is a non-prototypical function.\n\nExamples (52), (53) and (54) illustrate how verbs can be used referentiality with the use of the nominalising affixes -an, pa- and paN-. In (52) the noun tanaman, ‘plant’, is derived from the verb root tanam, ‘to plant’, in combination with the nominalising affix -an. The noun parampok, ‘thief’, in (53) makes use of the agentive nominaliser pa- to derive the form from the verb root rampok, ‘rob, steal’. The nominaliser -an is also used in (54) in combination with the paN- nominaliser to derive the noun panyalasaian, ‘ending’, from the verb root salasai, ‘finish’. Please see Section 6.3.1.2 for further discussion about Minangkabau nominalisers.\n\n(52) a.\n\nAmbo mananam bungo di kabun.\n1sg AV-plant flower LOC garden\n‘I planted some flowers in the garden.’\n\nb.

In addition to these parts of speech, Minangkabau also has a class of adverbs.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\npossible events. Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft\n"

This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nOne of the most interesting patterns of language use I observed in the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus was the high frequency of bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are unmarked for voice (see Chapter 6). This raised questions not only about the obligatoriness of voice marking but also how speakers are able to determine the semantic roles of the participants in the clause. Conducting elicitation was an essential stage in the process of understanding these bare verb forms because I was able to ask speakers about the restrictions on using these bare forms and also to test the productivity and use of these forms in syntactic and pragmatic contexts not found in the corpus.\n5 An Aqiqa is a Muslim ceremony in which a new born baby is named. 45\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nHowever, in some cases, as examples (263), (264) and (265) demonstrated, only extremely detailed knowledge of the context and pragmatics of the situation can provide the clues to work out the intended semantic roles of the bare verb’s arguments. But perhaps in these cases the speaker doesn’t intend anything, therefore the hearer has no need to disambiguate in the first place. Perhaps bare verb constructions don’t represent some kind of defective or underspecified version of a voice marked verb construction. Instead, they are used in cases where voice and semantic roles are not just underspecified, but unimportant. This is because ambiguity is a perfectly acceptable feature of Colloquial Minangkabau discourse. Gil (2002a; 2006) explores similar ideas\n211\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nand Shibatani (2006) claim that voice can encode an ‘event view’ distinction, that is voice can highlight a particular stage in the action encoded by the verb, whether this be the inception, development or termination of the action (see Chapter 5). Some Austronesian voice markers also have aspectual qualities which may be linked with their role in showing semantic and conceptual notions (cf. Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nOther linguists argue that voice is a semantic and conceptual phenomenon. For example, Gil (2002a) argues that the voice opposition between N- and di- in Riau Indonesian is used to show the relative conceptual saliency of the agent or patient participant rather than to encode any grammatical distinctions. Similarly, Croft (1994)\n18\n"

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source).

The origin of BH nag is also uncertain.\nSWY no is probably a secondary development of the third person possessive pronoun. Finally, the origin of IBN ti and kə are obscure; ti must be a contracted form, since in MUA tay (written ‘tai’) is found. No attempt at a reconstruction is made (the lack of comparative agreement makes it quite likely that PM did not have a relative clause marker).\n5.5.2.4 INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS Along with full interrogative pronouns, MIN has a series of short forms (a, ma, bar/a etc.,\nwritten ‘a’, ‘ma’, ‘bara’ etc. in Van der Toorn). *apa ‘what (interrogative)’ was reconstructed on the basis of reflexes in all isolects (3.1.1.4; IBN has apa (< SM or SAR?) besides nama). *mana( ?) ‘which’ is reconstructed on the basis of regular correspondences in all isolects but IBN. It should, however, be pointed out that MIN a could also be a contraction of an earlier +aha. This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2). Alongside *si-apa *sai ‘id.’ is also reconstructed on the basis of KD sad; it is not found elsewhere in the Malayic group, but cf. PMP *sa(y)i ‘id.’.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nfunction. However, a full historical analysis which accounts for di-’s appearance on verbs is still required. Furthermore, the question that was raised in Chapter 6 about how speakers correctly decode the intended meaning of an underspecified utterance, and how speakers correctly assign semantic roles to participants in a bare verb clause, also requires further empirical study.\n231\n\n\f232\n\n\fAppendices.\n\nAppendix 1.

In IBN this happened through prefixation of di-, and in the other isolects through prefixation of s-; in SM locative pronouns are usually precliticised by a locative preposition (viz. di ‘in, at’, kə ‘to(wards)’, and dari ‘from’). This leads to the following reconstructions:\n*(?)-(i)ni(?) ‘here’; ^l)-(i)tu(f) ‘there’; *(?)-(i)na(n) / *(?)-(a)na(?) ‘yonder’.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\napa mana mana siapa bila\n\nbar/a\n\nsa?apa\n\nindefinite\n\nanu\n\nanu\n\nanu\n\n(tu)apo mano -mano siapo kəbilo\nbaxapo\nanu\n\nnama ni -ni sapa kamaya\nbər/apa məsak\nanu?\n\napd mand -mani siapð kapan\nbər/apð\nanu/anð\n\n5.5.2.1 Demonstrative pronouns\nMost isolects have- a bipartite series of demonstratives, but it is likely that PM had a tripartite series: this would be in analogy with the locative pronouns (5.5.2.2) and with the IBN demonstratives. Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source). Nor do I have an explanation for the IBN demonstratives (note their agreement with Tagalog, which has itð referring to things close to the speaker).\n"

They may have a sound-symbolic value, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a stop or s + a liquid. Sometimes they are the result either of extension of a monosyllabic lexeme, or of reduction ofanother (non-monosyllabic) lexeme, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a nasal + a homorganic stop.

Nevertheless, the verb in (20a) is marked by the generalised active marker N- whereas the verb in (20b) is marked by the generalised patient marker di-. Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice. The sentences in (21) show two Riau Indonesian ‘neutral’ constructions in which the verb beli, ‘buy’, is unmarked.\n\n(21) a.\n\nBeli aku laser, kan.\nbuy 1sg laser Q\n‘I’ll buy a laser, right.’ [Context: Contemplating a shopping trip.]\n\n38\n\n\fb.

In (21a) notice that the verb is followed by the actor, the first person pronoun aku, and then the patient, laser, ‘ a laser’. However, in (21b) the verb is followed by the patient, nasi goreng, ‘fried rice’, and then the actor, aku.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n-r+1, e.g. bərlian ‘brilliant, diamond’ (< DU), pərlu ‘have to, need’ (< AR);\n- s + stop, e.g. məsd ‘must’ (< SKT), pistdl ‘pistol’ (< DU), miskin ‘poor’ (< AR), aspal ‘asphalt’ (< DU).\n(3) In inherited lexemes h only occurs intervocalically between like vowels.

Example (81) illustrates the use of the non-gradable stative predicate mati, ‘dead’. Stative predicates, like all predicate constructions, can be modified by preceding TAM adverbials.

In a few cases -an(l) occurs in combination with bə(r)-. It does so with VDIs, VSIs, and precategorials, and it yields reciprocal verbs with a stative meaning, bə(r)- -an(V) forms are often in free variation with bə(r)- forms and -an(l) forms, e.g.\n\nbəjubəl ‘crowd (v)’ bərgaul ‘associate (v)’ kənal ‘know, be acquainted with’ dəkət ‘close’ laðn ‘other’\n\nbəjubəlan ‘id.’ (Muhadjir 1981:49-50) bərgaulan ‘id.’ (Muhadjir 1981:49-50) bəkənalan,kənalan ‘get to know each other’ bədəkətan ‘be near (to each other)’ bəlaðnan ‘be different (from each other)’\n\n(One of Muhadjir's examples is actually derived from a noun: (bə)paearan, ‘be in love with each other’ is derived from pacar ‘girl- or boy-friend’.)\n\n-an(2) is suffixed to VSIs, VDIs, and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it yields nouns referring to objects which somehow have the quality of (VSI). These nouns are few in number and have a rather lexicalised meaning, e.g.\n\nmanis ‘sweet’ asin ‘sour, salty’\n\nmanisan ‘sweetened fruit candy’ asinan ‘k.o. food made of vegetables with peanut sauce’\n\nAbdul Chaer gives pand? whereas Muhadjir gives pano, without glottal stop (Muhadjir does not distinguish\nðand def. 2.6.1).\n\n\f172\n\nSuffixed to VDIs it yields abstract nouns or nouns referring to the place where the act is performed. When the resulting noun is an abstract noun, it is always followed by a nominal or a nominal phrase in the agentive role (Muhadjir 1981:60), e.g.\n\ntərðak ‘yell’ banðl ‘make jokes’ pdŋkðl ‘turn’\n\ntərbakan(lu) ‘(your) yelling’ bahdlan(-ne) ‘(her/his) joking’ peŋkðlan ‘intersection’\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n(79)\n\nAnak tu\n\nalah labiah tinggi dari udanyo.\n\nchild DEM:dist PFCT more tall from older.brother-3\n\n‘That kid is already taller than his older brother.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nHowever, a comparative marker is not absolutely necessary for a comparative reading of a gradable stative as (80) demonstrates. In this example the comparative marker labiah, ‘more’, on pendek, ‘short’, is missing but the interpretation shorter is still available. The comparative reading relies on the presence of the prepositional phrase dari pisau tu.\n\n(80)\n\nPisau ko\n\npendek dari pisau tu.\n\nknife DEM:prox short\n\nfrom knife DEM:dist\n\n‘This knife is shorter than that one.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n89\n\n\fNon-gradable states do no co-occur with comparative markers because they represent inherent polar states. Example (81) illustrates the use of the non-gradable stative predicate mati, ‘dead’. Stative predicates, like all predicate constructions, can be modified by preceding TAM adverbials. In (81) the TAM adverbial alah is used to mark perfective aspect. It is inserted before the stative predicate mati, but after the undergoer, maliang tu, ‘the thief’.\n\n(81)\n\nMaliang tu\n\nalah mati.\n\nthief\n\nDEM:dist PFCT dead\n\n‘The thief died.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAnother feature of stative predicates is that they productively derive active transitive verbs with the addition of active voice morphology and the applicative -an. Most active transitive verbs derived from statives this way will have a causative meaning. In (82) the active transitive verb mandinginan, ‘to cause to be cold’, has been derived by adding the active voice prefix maN- and the applicative -an to the stative root dingin.\n\n(82)\n\nAmbo mandinginan gulai.\n\n1sg AV-cold-APP curry\n\n‘I’m cooling down the curry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n"

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot.

            "summary": "Is there a comparative construction comprised of two conjoined clauses? Specifically, this construction must involve two conjoined clauses, one containing the standard of comparison and one containing the object of comparison, with no additional, obligatory, special markers of comparison (e.g. English *than*, or *surpass/exceed*). The NPs expressing the standard and object of comparison typically have the same function in the clauses. Note that many languages can juxtapose clauses (e.g. English *She is nice and he is not nice.*), however these sorts of constructions should only be considered for this feature when they are a dedicated way of expressing comparative meaning (e.g. when the structure clearly has a meaning like, ‘She is nicer than he is.’). In other words, we are focused on languages that have a dedicated comparative construction involving conjoined clauses.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. If the language has a dedicated comparative construction that involves two conjoined clauses, with the NPs expressing the standard and object of comparison functioning similarly in separate clauses, code 1.\n2. If the language can conjoin clauses in which an object of comparison and the standard of comparison function in similar roles, but this is not a dedicated comparative construction, code 0.\n3. If the language cannot express comparison through the use of two conjoined clauses as described above, code 0.\n\n",
            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nChomsky’s (1970) classification system also suggests that certain parts of speech are incompatible because their feature specifications are diametrically opposed; nouns and verbs cannot form a natural class and neither can adjectives and adpositions. Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class. However, this distinction is not captured by Chomsky’s (1970) classification framework.\n\n(22) a. John pounded the metal flat.\n\n(AP)\n\nb. John threw the ball into the barrel.

For example, the stative predicate cinto, ‘love’, in (189a) is turned into a superlative tacinto, ‘the most loved’, in (189b). There is also a change in argument status in the two examples. In (189a), uda, ‘older brother’, is the participant who loves, whereas in (189b), uda is the participant being loved.\n\n(189) a. b.\n\nUda\n\nnan cinto inyo.\n\nolder.brother REL love 3\n\n‘Older brother, who loves her.’\n\nUda\n\nnan tacinto dek inyo.\n\nolder.brother REL SUP-love CAUSE 3\n\n‘Older brother who is the most loved by her.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n152\n\n\fIn example (190) the stative predicate gadang, ‘big’, is also turned into a superlative, tagadang, ‘the biggest’, with the addition of ta- in (190b). Notice in (190c) that ta- can also create an involuntary predicate from gadang: tagadang, ‘accidentally stretched’. I treat superlative ta- and involuntary ta- as two different uses of the same multifunctional prefix. In cases where the meaning is ambiguous and both the superlative and involuntary readings of ta- are possible, the exact reading of ta- will be determined by discourse and contextual factors.\n\n(190) a.\n\nBaju nan dibali tu\n\ngadang.\n\nshirt REL PV-buy DEM:dist big\n\n‘The shirt that he bought is big.’\n\nb.

In this example the comparative marker labiah, ‘more’, on pendek, ‘short’, is missing but the interpretation shorter is still available. The comparative reading relies on the presence of the prepositional phrase dari pisau tu.\n\n(80)\n\nPisau ko\n\npendek dari pisau tu.\n\nknife DEM:prox short\n\nfrom knife DEM:dist\n\n‘This knife is shorter than that one.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n89\n\n\fNon-gradable states do no co-occur with comparative markers because they represent inherent polar states. Example (81) illustrates the use of the non-gradable stative predicate mati, ‘dead’. Stative predicates, like all predicate constructions, can be modified by preceding TAM adverbials. In (81) the TAM adverbial alah is used to mark perfective aspect. It is inserted before the stative predicate mati, but after the undergoer, maliang tu, ‘the thief’.\n\n(81)\n\nMaliang tu\n\nalah mati.\n\nthief\n\nDEM:dist PFCT dead\n\n‘The thief died.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAnother feature of stative predicates is that they productively derive active transitive verbs with the addition of active voice morphology and the applicative -an. Most active transitive verbs derived from statives this way will have a causative meaning. In (82) the active transitive verb mandinginan, ‘to cause to be cold’, has been derived by adding the active voice prefix maN- and the applicative -an to the stative root dingin.\n\n(82)\n\nAmbo mandinginan gulai.\n\n1sg AV-cold-APP curry\n\n‘I’m cooling down the curry.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

We specifically focus on comparative constructions where the standard of comparison is overtly expressed (e.g. meanings like ‘Maria is taller than John’) but also count clearly comparative forms where the standard of comparison is null/implied/inferred from the context (e.g. meanings like ‘Maria is taller’). The comparative constructions of interest express superiority (as in the French and English examples above), not inferiority (e.g. meanings like ‘John is less athletic than Maria’).\n\nThis feature requires that the degree marker modify the property word. It should not be phonologically bound.\n\n",

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb. In (51c) the prefixation of the active voice marker maN- creates a change of state verb from the root word and in (51d) the addition of the applicative –an derives a transitive, causative verb.\n\n(51) a.\n\nBaju itame tu\n\nnan gaek-gaek tu.\n\nshirt black-3 DEM:dist REL RED-old DEM:dist\n\n‘The old people wear black shirts.’\n\n(Text ID: 445038115055260406)\n73\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nballoon DEM:dist AV-big\n\nCAUSE PV-blow\n\n‘The balloon got bigger from being blown up.’\n\nd.

This then allows for a distinction to be made between stative verbs, which are not gradable, and a special class of property words that are gradable (Steinhauer, 2008). In fact, property words crosslinguistically are comparative, i.e. gradable (Anderson, 1985; Croft, 1991; Dixon, 1982; Schachter, 1985), which stative verbs are not. In Minangkabau, property words are gradable too, as example (50) shows; the comparative prefix sa- on gadang, ‘big’, shows that gadang is gradable. According to Langacker’s (1987b) terminology, this\n9 Rumah Gadang translates literally as ‘big house’ but the term is actually used to refer to the distinctive Minangkabau traditional houses with pointed curved rooves intended to signify the horns of a water buffalo.\n72\n\n\fmeans that gadang is relational and therefore notionally an adjective. However, as we established in Section 4.1.2.1, stative verbs can also be construed as relational since their meaning is framed against a polar opposite.\n\n(50)\n\nBulek-bulek sagadang talua puyuah.\n\nRED-round COMP-big egg quail\n\n‘It is round and as big as a quail’s egg.’\n\n(Text ID: 217881132319230306)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n(79)\n\nAnak tu\n\nalah labiah tinggi dari udanyo.\n\nchild DEM:dist PFCT more tall from older.brother-3\n\n‘That kid is already taller than his older brother.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nHowever, a comparative marker is not absolutely necessary for a comparative reading of a gradable stative as (80) demonstrates. In this example the comparative marker labiah, ‘more’, on pendek, ‘short’, is missing but the interpretation shorter is still available. The comparative reading relies on the presence of the prepositional phrase dari pisau tu.\n\n(80)\n\nPisau ko\n\npendek dari pisau tu.\n\nknife DEM:prox short\n\nfrom knife DEM:dist\n\n‘This knife is shorter than that one.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n89\n\n\fNon-gradable states do no co-occur with comparative markers because they represent inherent polar states. Example (81) illustrates the use of the non-gradable stative predicate mati, ‘dead’. Stative predicates, like all predicate constructions, can be modified by preceding TAM adverbials. In (81) the TAM adverbial alah is used to mark perfective aspect. It is inserted before the stative predicate mati, but after the undergoer, maliang tu, ‘the thief’.\n\n(81)\n\nMaliang tu\n\nalah mati.\n\nthief\n\nDEM:dist PFCT dead\n\n‘The thief died.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAnother feature of stative predicates is that they productively derive active transitive verbs with the addition of active voice morphology and the applicative -an. Most active transitive verbs derived from statives this way will have a causative meaning. In (82) the active transitive verb mandinginan, ‘to cause to be cold’, has been derived by adding the active voice prefix maN- and the applicative -an to the stative root dingin.\n\n(82)\n\nAmbo mandinginan gulai.\n\n1sg AV-cold-APP curry\n\n‘I’m cooling down the curry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n178\ndegree.

                "content": "Foley (1998: 30) proposes that if roots do not entail argument structure, then they specify “some generalized conceptual structure” in the lexicon instead. For example, he suggests that a root like bigay, ‘give’, will specify the conceptual paradigm ‘giving by X of Y to Z’, but will not specify how X, Y and Z’s semantic roles map onto argument structure. The role of voice morphology is then to specify how the semantic roles specified by the root’s conceptual structure ought to be realised syntactically. To do this, the root must first become a verb. So, according to Foley, voice morphology actually performs a single derivational process: deriving a verb from a precategorial root and selecting a specific semantic role as the pivot.\nSince argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, according to Foley (1998; 2008) this means that there is no preference as to which of the participants entailed by the root’s conceptual structure gets realised as the pivot. This, he argues, shows that no one voice type is basic and that voice in Philippine-type languages is ‘symmetrical’ (see Section 2.1). Naturally, precategoriality and symmetrical voice systems are complementary features and it is these features, he argues, that are typologically salient in Philippine-type languages.\nNevertheless, whether Philippine-type languages are precategorial or not is still a matter of debate and a number of alternate analyses have been put forward. Two of these alternate analyses are discussed here. First, we will examine Kroeger’s (1998) argument against precategoriality, and second, we will discuss Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) proposal that the morphology of Philippine-type languages is multifunctional.",

For example, he suggests that a root like bigay, ‘give’, will specify the conceptual paradigm ‘giving by X of Y to Z’, but will not specify how X, Y and Z’s semantic roles map onto argument structure. The role of voice morphology is then to specify how the semantic roles specified by the root’s conceptual structure ought to be realised syntactically. To do this, the root must first become a verb. So, according to Foley, voice morphology actually performs a single derivational process: deriving a verb from a precategorial root and selecting a specific semantic role as the pivot.\nSince argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, according to Foley (1998; 2008) this means that there is no preference as to which of the participants entailed by the root’s conceptual structure gets realised as the pivot. This, he argues, shows that no one voice type is basic and that voice in Philippine-type languages is ‘symmetrical’ (see Section 2.1). Naturally, precategoriality and symmetrical voice systems are complementary features and it is these features, he argues, that are typologically salient in Philippine-type languages.\nNevertheless, whether Philippine-type languages are precategorial or not is still a matter of debate and a number of alternate analyses have been put forward. Two of these alternate analyses are discussed here. First, we will examine Kroeger’s (1998) argument against precategoriality, and second, we will discuss Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) proposal that the morphology of Philippine-type languages is multifunctional.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nHowever, in some cases, as examples (263), (264) and (265) demonstrated, only extremely detailed knowledge of the context and pragmatics of the situation can provide the clues to work out the intended semantic roles of the bare verb’s arguments. But perhaps in these cases the speaker doesn’t intend anything, therefore the hearer has no need to disambiguate in the first place. Perhaps bare verb constructions don’t represent some kind of defective or underspecified version of a voice marked verb construction. Instead, they are used in cases where voice and semantic roles are not just underspecified, but unimportant. This is because ambiguity is a perfectly acceptable feature of Colloquial Minangkabau discourse. Gil (2002a; 2006) explores similar ideas\n211\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nBaa\n\nko\n\nnyo tokokan Ø kayak gitu tu\n\nYes?\n\nPOSS-what DEM:prox 3 hit-APP Ø like DEM:dist DEM:dist TRU-Maiyes\n\n‘How come he hit (it) like that Yes?’\n\n(Text ID: 170492105523080606)\n\nConstructions like those presented in (155) and (156) are frequently found in Colloquial Minangkabau, suggesting that speakers regularly use bare verb forms, even in cases where one or more of the verb’s arguments are unexpressed.

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nHimmelmann (2006a; 2008) proposes an alternative solution to both Foley’s (1998; 2008) and Kroeger’s (1998) analyses. Like Foley (1998), he argues that voice affixation is by definition derivational; there is no one basic voice type and all words bearing voice marking must belong to the same morphosyntactic class of verb regardless of their lexical class (Himmelmann, 2008). However, instead of arguing for or against the precategoriality hypothesis, he proposes that it is the multifunctionality and polysemy of\n\n216\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nOther linguists argue that voice is a semantic and conceptual phenomenon. For example, Gil (2002a) argues that the voice opposition between N- and di- in Riau Indonesian is used to show the relative conceptual saliency of the agent or patient participant rather than to encode any grammatical distinctions. Similarly, Croft (1994)\n18\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nthus equating them with adjectives, or do we negate both the operators, describing them as [-noun, -verb] and leaving no way of distinguishing them from adpositions? What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nand Shibatani (2006) claim that voice can encode an ‘event view’ distinction, that is voice can highlight a particular stage in the action encoded by the verb, whether this be the inception, development or termination of the action (see Chapter 5). Some Austronesian voice markers also have aspectual qualities which may be linked with their role in showing semantic and conceptual notions (cf. Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised.

Beli nasi goreng aku.\n\nbuy rice fry\n\n1sg\n\n‘I bought the fried rice.’\n\n[Context: Group of people decide they want to play cards; somebody tells\n\nspeaker to go out and buy some; speaker objects on the grounds that it's\n\nsomebody else's turn to go out.]\n\n(Gil, 2006: 43)\n\nLike the generalised active and passive constructions, a ‘neutral’ construction does not entail any shift in grammatical relations and actor and patient NPs are unrestricted in terms of which position in the clause they can appear. In (21a) notice that the verb is followed by the actor, the first person pronoun aku, and then the patient, laser, ‘ a laser’. However, in (21b) the verb is followed by the patient, nasi goreng, ‘fried rice’, and then the actor, aku.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n(40)\n\nMereka tidak menolong kami.\n\n3pl\n\nNEG AV-help 1pl\n\n‘They didn’t help us.’\n\n(adapted from Sneddon, 1996: 195)\n\n(41)\n\nDia bukan guru.\n\n3 NEG teacher\n\n‘He is not a teacher.’\n\n(adapted from Sneddon, 1996: 195)\n\nHowever, in Minangkabau, both nouns and verbs are negated by indak (or the reduced form ndak). In (42) the NP guru, ‘teacher’, is negated by indak and in (43) the verbal predicate manggigik, ‘bite’, is also negated by indak. This means that the presence of indak or ndak cannot be diagnostic for whether we a dealing with a verb or a noun.\n\n(42)\n\nJadi nyo indak guru do?\n\nbecome 3 NEG teacher NEGPOL\n\n‘So she’s not a teacher?’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(43)\n\nUla tu\n\nbabunuah supayo indak manggigik.\n\nsnake DEM:dist MID-kill in.order.that NEG AV-bite\n\n‘The snake was killed so that it wouldn’t bite (anyone).’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nMinangkabau uses a different negation strategy for imperative verbs. Instead of using indak, the prohibitive particle jan is inserted before the verb (see Section 4.3.2.5). An example of this can be seen in (44), where the prohibitive particle jan negates the verb masak, ‘cook’. Jan cannot be used with NPs as example (45a) shows. To use a prohibitive construction with an NP, the verb jadi, ‘become, happen’, must be used, as shown in example (45b).\n69\n\n\f(44)\n\nJan masak nasi kini, beko se.\n\nPROHIB cook rice now later just\n\n‘Don't cook the rice now, just do it later.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(45) a.\n\n*Jan guru.\nPROHIB teacher\n‘Don’t be a teacher.’\n\nb. Jan jadi guru.\nPROHIB become teacher\n‘Don’t be a teacher.’\n(Elicitation)\n\nAnother formal property of verbs in that they show tense, aspect and mood distinctions. In Minangkabau TAM distinctions are not morphologically marked on the verb. Instead the verb is modified by preceding adverbial TAM markers (see Table 14).\n\nThree TAM adverbials, nio, alah and alun, are exemplified in examples (46), (47) and (48) respectively. Notice that the TAM markers precede the verb in all examples.\n\n(46)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nfunction. However, a full historical analysis which accounts for di-’s appearance on verbs is still required. Furthermore, the question that was raised in Chapter 6 about how speakers correctly decode the intended meaning of an underspecified utterance, and how speakers correctly assign semantic roles to participants in a bare verb clause, also requires further empirical study.\n231\n\n\f232\n\n\fAppendices.\n\nAppendix 1.

The subset can be expressed with different word classes such as proper nouns, numerals, demonstratives, etc. Inclusory constructions often take the form of nominal coordination constructions.\n\n",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nand J.

Kroeger (1998) argues that the Kimaragang infix -in-, although used as a marker of past tense when combined with verbal roots, can also function as a nominaliser, combining not only with verbal roots but nominal and adjectival ones as well. Kroeger (1998) argues that the resultant nominalisations are lexically distinct from the past tense forms of the verbs and also have unpredictable semantics. Some examples of nominalisations based on verbal roots in Kimaragang can be found in (284). Note that the -in- infix results in a semantic narrowing of the root in the nominalised forms.\n215\n"

However, di- does not behave like a prefix in Minangkabau. Williams (1961: 66-67) labels the Minangkabau passive voice marker di- a “quasi prefix” but I argue that it is a proclitic. Evidence\n132\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nVOICE MARKER\ntapamaNba-an -i\n\nFUNCTION\nInvoluntary, superlative & ability predicates Causative voice Active voice Middle voice Applicative Locative applicative\n\n3. The passive voice marker di- is a clitic. Its primary function is syntactic, whereas other Minangkabau voice markers function primarily in the semantic and lexical/derivational domain.\n4. Naturalistic, conversational and informal data reveal that bare verbs (i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice) are a prevalent feature of Colloquial Minangkabau.\n5. Bare verbs show that morphological underspecification is acceptable in Colloquial Minangkabau.\n6. The existence of bare verbs does not entail that Minangkabau is a precategorial language. In fact, Minangkabau has a clear lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.\n\n16\n\n\f17\n"

It should, however, be pointed out that MIN a could also be a contraction of an earlier +aha. This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2). Alongside *si-apa *sai ‘id.’ is also reconstructed on the basis of KD sad; it is not found elsewhere in the Malayic group, but cf. PMP *sa(y)i ‘id.’.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n18\nh is only inherited in final position.41 In this position it occurs in Helfrich, but is not represented in Aliana et al.; hence it is written between brackets in this study. According to Helfrich stress falls on the penultimate syllable of a word, unless this contains a schwa (in which case it falls on the final syllable); stress is not phonemic, and there are no other phonemic suprasegmental features.\n\n2.4.2 SWY MORPHOPHONEMIC ALTERNATIONS\n\nA. Nasalisation of actor-oriented verbs, affixation of the nominalising affixes paN- and paNan, yield the following alternations:\n\n(1) velar nasal accretion for initial vowels, e.g.\n\n(adil): (ikat): (ukur):\n\nŋadili ‘give judgement’, paŋadilan ‘law court’ rpkat‘bind’, pəŋikat‘s.th. to bind’ ŋukur‘measure’, pəŋukur‘measurer, gauger’\n\n(2) homorganic nasal substitution for initial stops, e.g.\n\n(potfi(h)): (pikul): (bali): (buka7): (dagax): (dapat): (timbo): (tufijiP7): (cukur): (jaliŋ): (jait): (kapur) (in (kildr): (gundal): (gantuŋ):\n\nHelfrich\n\nkapux):\n\nmotp(h) ‘make white’ pamikul ‘s.o. carrying a yoke’ mali ‘buy’ pəmuka 7 ‘entrepreneur’ nayax ‘hear’ pənapat ‘opinion’ nimbo ‘bale (water)’ pənunju37 ‘pointer’ nukiir ‘shave’, pafiukur ‘barber’ nəliŋ ‘look sidelong, squint’ panait ‘dressmaker, n*eedle ŋapur ‘whitewash’ pərpjdr‘a file’ ŋundali ‘throw at (s.th.)’ pəŋantuŋan ‘place to hang s.th.’\n\nN.B. As the above examples show, in Aliana et al. stops become homorganic nasals. Helfrich, however, is vague about the exact nature of nasalisation of stops, but from his examples it appears that voiceless stops usually become homorganic nasals, and that voiced stops usually have homorganic nasal accretion. Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nFrom the above chart it appears that all isolects agree in showing homorganic nasal substitution for initial p, t, k, and palatal nasal substitution for s, and no change at all before initial nasal. Except for IBN, they all agree in showing homorganic nasal accretion before initial voiced stops (in SWY homorganic nasal accretion is still found in Helfrich's description, whereas voiced stops are replaced by homorganic nasals in Aliana et al.; cases with homorganic nasal replacement of voiced stops in Helfrich are incidental, 2.4.2). One could argue that nasalisation originally did not occur before liquids, and that it appeared in this position in IBN and JKT because of the need for a formal indication of agentorientedness.\nBut it is not possible to reconstruct a sound set of morphophonemic alternations for *mAN(l)- apart from that of homorganic nasal accretion before voiced stops, homorganic nasal substitution for initial *p, *t, *k, palatal nasal substitution for initial *s, and loss of the ★N in *mAN(l)- before an initial nasal.\n\n\f161\n\nAs for *mAN(2)-, it apparently had the same morphophonemic alternations as *mAN(l)-: only IBN has a different set of alternations, but since the IBN distinction between nasal substitution and nasal accretion as an indication of transitivity and intransitivity respectively is not found elsewhere among Malay isolects, it will not play a part in the reconstruction of PM. The difference between PM *mAN(l)- and *mAN(2)-, then, was only a functional one.\n"

However, he argues that the aspectual distinctions are a result of some clauses being foregrounding, i.e. they are central to the development of the narrative and are perfective, and some clauses being backgrounding, i.e. they provide information that supports, but is not central to, the main events of the narrative and are imperfective. He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n5.5.2.2 LOCATIVE PRONOUNS\nIn all isolects, locative pronouns are derived from demonstratives.

These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes. Table 10 lists each of these formal properties of verbs and describes how these properties are realised in Minangkabau.\n67\n\n\fTable 10.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nthus equating them with adjectives, or do we negate both the operators, describing them as [-noun, -verb] and leaving no way of distinguishing them from adpositions? What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nChomsky’s (1970) classification system also suggests that certain parts of speech are incompatible because their feature specifications are diametrically opposed; nouns and verbs cannot form a natural class and neither can adjectives and adpositions. Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class. However, this distinction is not captured by Chomsky’s (1970) classification framework.\n\n(22) a. John pounded the metal flat.\n\n(AP)\n\nb. John threw the ball into the barrel.

However, a full historical analysis which accounts for di-’s appearance on verbs is still required. Furthermore, the question that was raised in Chapter 6 about how speakers correctly decode the intended meaning of an underspecified utterance, and how speakers correctly assign semantic roles to participants in a bare verb clause, also requires further empirical study.\n231\n\n\f232\n\n\fAppendices.\n\nAppendix 1.

Whether a group of consonants is realised as a cluster or acquires an epenthetic schwa depends among other things on the number of syllables in the lexeme. Disyllabism is favouredin the canonical shape of JKT lexemes, and the insertion of ə would often result in more than two syllables. Nevertheless, there are inherited JKT lexemes which always occur with an initial consonant cluster, and which can form a contrasting minimal pair with lexemes containing a schwa. They may have a sound-symbolic value, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a stop or s + a liquid. Sometimes they are the result either of extension of a monosyllabic lexeme, or of reduction ofanother (non-monosyllabic) lexeme, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a nasal + a homorganic stop. (Grijns 1981:19-28). In the word-structural interpretation underlying Abdul Chaer's dictionary, initial clusters of s + a liquid do not occur. 73This list of clusters is not exhaustive (Abdul Chaer 1976:passim).",

The valency of kə- -an(l) etc. differs from one isolect to the other, and the only feature common to all isolects (except IBN) is that they have ka- -an(l) etc. affixed to nouns. But kə- -an( 1) etc. also occurs with verbs in SM, MIN, SWY, and JKT, and I will reconstruct a PM ancestor which occurred on the basis of verbs and nouns, and which denoted unintentionality and feasibility. As to its function of forming comparatives with VSIs in MIN and of forming excessives with VSIs in BH, this is an even smaller base for a PM reconstruction than in the case of tor- etc. with VSIs (cf. 6.2.2). Since kə- -an(V) and ter- etc. are to a great extent similar in function and meaning, a difference in distribution would be expected between them. However, I have not been able to discover any such difference that would hold for all isolects.\nAll isolects except IBN have a correspondence Of SM kə- -an(2) occurring with VSIs and forming nouns referring to the quality denoted by (VSI). JKT kə- -an(T), however, may not be inherited. SM kə- -an(2) and MIN ka- -an(2) also occur with VDIs (forming abstract nouns, and nouns referring to the place where the action is performed). In BH, ka- -an(2) is found with VDIs, but here the resulting noun exclusively refers to the place where the action is performed. It is therefore possible to reconstruct a PM ancestral form of SM ka- -an(2) which on the basis of VSIs formed nouns referring to the quality of (VSI) as such, and which on the basis of VDIs formed nouns at least referring to the place where (VDI) takes place.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n-r+1, e.g. bərlian ‘brilliant, diamond’ (< DU), pərlu ‘have to, need’ (< AR);\n- s + stop, e.g. məsd ‘must’ (< SKT), pistdl ‘pistol’ (< DU), miskin ‘poor’ (< AR), aspal ‘asphalt’ (< DU).\n(3) In inherited lexemes h only occurs intervocalically between like vowels. It sometimes alternates with 7 as in puhun,pu?un ‘tree’.\n72Grijns says that most bases with an initial cluster have a variant form with an epenthetic schwa between the consonants. Whether a group of consonants is realised as a cluster or acquires an epenthetic schwa depends among other things on the number of syllables in the lexeme. Disyllabism is favouredin the canonical shape of JKT lexemes, and the insertion of ə would often result in more than two syllables. Nevertheless, there are inherited JKT lexemes which always occur with an initial consonant cluster, and which can form a contrasting minimal pair with lexemes containing a schwa. They may have a sound-symbolic value, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a stop or s + a liquid. Sometimes they are the result either of extension of a monosyllabic lexeme, or of reduction ofanother (non-monosyllabic) lexeme, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a nasal + a homorganic stop. (Grijns 1981:19-28). In the word-structural interpretation underlying Abdul Chaer's dictionary, initial clusters of s + a liquid do not occur. 73This list of clusters is not exhaustive (Abdul Chaer 1976:passim).\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n18\nh is only inherited in final position.41 In this position it occurs in Helfrich, but is not represented in Aliana et al.; hence it is written between brackets in this study.

The marking should occur with an [open set of nouns](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity), not with a restricted set. This feature contrasts with [GB165 Is there a productive morphological trial marker on nouns?](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB165) which focuses on the bound marking of trial number. For more on wordhood and bound marking, please see [this page](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/%27on-the-verb-noun%27-or-%27by-morphology%27). \n\nNumber marking is often fused with marking of other categories, such as definiteness/specificity or gender/noun class. It is possible for the number marker to also signal other functions and still be coded as 1, as long as the other functions do not interfere with the number distinction and as long as number marking is productive and regular. \n\nIt can be difficult to determine how [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) markers of dual, trial and paucal number are since they can often be replaced by plural number marking.

Firstly, paN- and its correspondences do not refer to the location where the action or event takes place.

Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT). Fourthly, the syntactical role of SM paN- and MIN paN- is quite different from the (more restricted) role of their correspondences in other isolects.

Cases of multifunctionality abound in Minangkabau morphology and the language’s lexical/derivational affixes ta-, pa- and ba- are particularly multifunctional (see Section 5.2). The correlations between the syntactic and semantic properties of the root and the meaning or syntactic function of the affix being profiled are relatively transparent. For example, ta- derives superlative forms only from stative roots and creates stative ‘ability’ predicates only from transitive verb roots. Nevertheless it remains difficult to clarify the exact correlations between the category of the root and the intended use of the affix in a number of other cases, for example the causative marker pa- when it occurs with non-stative roots (see Section 5.2.2).",

Chapter 7 follows the developments from PAN to PM; an account is given of the sound changes and of the phonotactic and lexical changes that took place between PAN and PM. Chapter 8 is a concluding chapter, which includes a summary of the most important findings, suggestions for further research and some ideas on subclassification of Malayic isolects and on the PM homeland.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nThere are a few general remarks that can be made on the above picture. Firstly, paN- and its correspondences do not refer to the location where the action or event takes place. An exception to this is IBN paN- which, as the only nominalising affix in IBN, has generalised its meaning in a maximal way. Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT). Fourthly, the syntactical role of SM paN- and MIN paN- is quite different from the (more restricted) role of their correspondences in other isolects. This fact is very important for the reconstruction of a PM ancestor, because for SM\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nprocesses in Minangkabau are not unique. However, this evidence alone is not sufficient to argue that the language is precategorial.\n6.3.1.3 Multifunctional Morphology\nOf course, it could be the case that the nominalisers pa- and -an, and the verbal markers pa- and -an are not homophonous, but the same, multifunctional morphemes. Cases of multifunctionality abound in Minangkabau morphology and the language’s lexical/derivational affixes ta-, pa- and ba- are particularly multifunctional (see Section 5.2). The correlations between the syntactic and semantic properties of the root and the meaning or syntactic function of the affix being profiled are relatively transparent. For example, ta- derives superlative forms only from stative roots and creates stative ‘ability’ predicates only from transitive verb roots. Nevertheless it remains difficult to clarify the exact correlations between the category of the root and the intended use of the affix in a number of other cases, for example the causative marker pa- when it occurs with non-stative roots (see Section 5.2.2).\n"

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot.

Indirect evidentiality usually involves inference from physical evidence or second-hand knowledge such as hearsay.

This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2).

Here we are interested in identifying languages that frequently or generally use an interrogative construction with nominal wh-constituents in situ.

In IBN this happened through prefixation of di-, and in the other isolects through prefixation of s-; in SM locative pronouns are usually precliticised by a locative preposition (viz. di ‘in, at’, kə ‘to(wards)’, and dari ‘from’). This leads to the following reconstructions:\n*(?)-(i)ni(?) ‘here’; ^l)-(i)tu(f) ‘there’; *(?)-(i)na(n) / *(?)-(a)na(?) ‘yonder’.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nBaa\n\nko\n\nnyo tokokan Ø kayak gitu tu\n\nYes?\n\nPOSS-what DEM:prox 3 hit-APP Ø like DEM:dist DEM:dist TRU-Maiyes\n\n‘How come he hit (it) like that Yes?’\n\n(Text ID: 170492105523080606)\n\nConstructions like those presented in (155) and (156) are frequently found in Colloquial Minangkabau, suggesting that speakers regularly use bare verb forms, even in cases where one or more of the verb’s arguments are unexpressed. These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nHowever, in some cases, as examples (263), (264) and (265) demonstrated, only extremely detailed knowledge of the context and pragmatics of the situation can provide the clues to work out the intended semantic roles of the bare verb’s arguments.

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

The origin of BH nag is also uncertain.\nSWY no is probably a secondary development of the third person possessive pronoun. Finally, the origin of IBN ti and kə are obscure; ti must be a contracted form, since in MUA tay (written ‘tai’) is found. No attempt at a reconstruction is made (the lack of comparative agreement makes it quite likely that PM did not have a relative clause marker).\n5.5.2.4 INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS Along with full interrogative pronouns, MIN has a series of short forms (a, ma, bar/a etc.,\nwritten ‘a’, ‘ma’, ‘bara’ etc. in Van der Toorn). *apa ‘what (interrogative)’ was reconstructed on the basis of reflexes in all isolects (3.1.1.4; IBN has apa (< SM or SAR?) besides nama). *mana( ?) ‘which’ is reconstructed on the basis of regular correspondences in all isolects but IBN. It should, however, be pointed out that MIN a could also be a contraction of an earlier +aha. This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2). Alongside *si-apa *sai ‘id.’ is also reconstructed on the basis of KD sad; it is not found elsewhere in the Malayic group, but cf. PMP *sa(y)i ‘id.’.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nOf all the kinds of clauses with bare verb stems, the most interesting are those cases where the intended semantic roles of the participants are most ambiguous. These cases indicate the importance of pragmatics for determining semantic roles and also raise questions about the importance of specifying semantic roles in the first place. These issues are discussed further in Section 6.2.\n198\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nThe pivot is a useful concept for talking about grammatical relations in Philippine-type languages because its grammatical functions are not adequately characterised by a universal definition of ‘subject’ (cf. Keenan, 1976). Schachter (1976; 1977) argues that subjects have both reference related properties, i.e. the subject is typically the most referentially salient participant in the clause and it thus has control over the syntactic\n19\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n5.5.2.2 LOCATIVE PRONOUNS\nIn all isolects, locative pronouns are derived from demonstratives. In IBN this happened through prefixation of di-, and in the other isolects through prefixation of s-; in SM locative pronouns are usually precliticised by a locative preposition (viz. di ‘in, at’, kə ‘to(wards)’, and dari ‘from’). This leads to the following reconstructions:\n*(?)-(i)ni(?) ‘here’; ^l)-(i)tu(f) ‘there’; *(?)-(i)na(n) / *(?)-(a)na(?) ‘yonder’.\n"

There are two exceptions, both of which are SKT loanwords, viz. ərti ‘meaning’, ərto ‘goods’. (3) As a rule trisyllabic bases have an antepenultimate schwa. (4) Diphthongs only occur in the last syllable of a lexeme: -ay and -awonly occur lexeme finally (as in bagkay ‘corpse’ and pulaw ‘island’); i9 and uə only occur before final? and before Helfrich's final h (which does not occur in Aliana et al., see 2.4.1), e.g. kəei97 ‘small’, flu®? ‘beautiful’, bərsfi(h) ‘clean’, jaifi(h) ‘far’.

Zorc considers IBN lexemes with a diphthongised last syllable to be evidence for the development of PAN *5, *H, and *i’to IBN -7, which is unwarranted since there is no way of telling whether earlier (undiphthongised) forms of these lexemes had -'’or not. The lexemes in question are: tuay, umay, kitay, tubay, bugay, and n/aday, better evidence for *kitaHis IBN kita7 ‘you (plural)’ (if this is not a SAR loan, cf. 3.2.3). Furthermore, IBN (and also Mualang) have a fossilised suffix -7, which marks transitivity (see 6.1.1). It is a reflex of the PAN locative focus marker, and it corresponds to -i in Philippine and Formosan languages (Wolff 1973:73, 77). It is not likely that the -7 in IBN -i7 reflects a PAN laryngeal, since no corresponding consonant is found in Formosan or Philippine languages. But more important criticism to Zorc's sound law is that there are too many unexplained IBN exceptions. To start with, his evidence for PAN *-S > IBN -7 is too weak.110065 There are only three cases out of nine that support this correspondence, viz. dga7, pari7 and tuma7. In two cases the IBN reflexes do not provide evidence viz. tuay and paah (-h unexplained), and four reflexes provide counterevidence: tabu, tali, dai, and kuku. Evidence for PAN *-H > IBN -7 is much stronger, although here too one is left with a considerable number of exceptions. Out of 17 examples, 11 (including kita7 ‘you (plural)’) exemplify the change, viz. bara7, baru7, daki7, iu7, jawa7, jarami7, kita7, lima7, tai7, tapa7, and tau7; two do not provide evidence because of the diphthongisation of the last syllable (kitay not included), viz.\n105See fn. 102. 106Seefn. 102.",

Zorc considers IBN lexemes with a diphthongised last syllable to be evidence for the development of PAN *5, *H, and *i’to IBN -7, which is unwarranted since there is no way of telling whether earlier (undiphthongised) forms of these lexemes had -'’or not. The lexemes in question are: tuay, umay, kitay, tubay, bugay, and n/aday, better evidence for *kitaHis IBN kita7 ‘you (plural)’ (if this is not a SAR loan, cf. 3.2.3). Furthermore, IBN (and also Mualang) have a fossilised suffix -7, which marks transitivity (see 6.1.1). It is a reflex of the PAN locative focus marker, and it corresponds to -i in Philippine and Formosan languages (Wolff 1973:73, 77). It is not likely that the -7 in IBN -i7 reflects a PAN laryngeal, since no corresponding consonant is found in Formosan or Philippine languages. But more important criticism to Zorc's sound law is that there are too many unexplained IBN exceptions. To start with, his evidence for PAN *-S > IBN -7 is too weak.110065 There are only three cases out of nine that support this correspondence, viz. dga7, pari7 and tuma7. In two cases the IBN reflexes do not provide evidence viz. tuay and paah (-h unexplained), and four reflexes provide counterevidence: tabu, tali, dai, and kuku. Evidence for PAN *-H > IBN -7 is much stronger, although here too one is left with a considerable number of exceptions. Out of 17 examples, 11 (including kita7 ‘you (plural)’) exemplify the change, viz. bara7, baru7, daki7, iu7, jawa7, jarami7, kita7, lima7, tai7, tapa7, and tau7; two do not provide evidence because of the diphthongisation of the last syllable (kitay not included), viz.\n105See fn. 102. 106Seefn. 102.\n"

In BAC one finds sapulu sabua, sapulu dua, sapulu tolu for ‘eleven’, ‘twelve’, ‘thirteen’ etc. (Stokhof 1980:97-98). These three isolects agree with PMP, where teens are formed with *sa-puluq + a cardinal number.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\nINDEX\n\nN.B.

Each C can be 0, and intervocalic C\ncan also be a cluster (see below). Monosyllables, trisyllables and tetrasyllables also occur. Constraints on the distribution of vowels:\n(1) Schwa does not occur in final syllables. (2) Initial schwa is always followed by a nasal or, in one case, a liquid (cf. əlaŋ, lag ‘kite (bird)’). There are two exceptions, both of which are SKT loanwords, viz. ərti ‘meaning’, ərto ‘goods’. (3) As a rule trisyllabic bases have an antepenultimate schwa. (4) Diphthongs only occur in the last syllable of a lexeme: -ay and -awonly occur lexeme finally (as in bagkay ‘corpse’ and pulaw ‘island’); i9 and uə only occur before final? and before Helfrich's final h (which does not occur in Aliana et al., see 2.4.1), e.g. kəei97 ‘small’, flu®? ‘beautiful’, bərsfi(h) ‘clean’, jaifi(h) ‘far’. (5) There are two mid-vowels, one of which, e, does not occur in Helfrich (2.4.1); odoes occur in Helfrich, but not in final closed syllables.\n"

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nfunction.

However, he argues that the aspectual distinctions are a result of some clauses being foregrounding, i.e. they are central to the development of the narrative and are perfective, and some clauses being backgrounding, i.e. they provide information that supports, but is not central to, the main events of the narrative and are imperfective. He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.",

Suppletion is a process where a lexeme is changed in such a way that the new form does not resemble the previous when it appears in a different position in the paradigm.

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nhad gone. Contrastively, example (10) shows the use of the di- verbs ditumbok, ‘mash’, and diminum, ‘drink’. According to Rafferty (1982: 46), in this example the verbs refer to “real (past, present or future) events” and that the di- prefix therefore encodes perfective aspect.\n\n(9)\n\nPas amblas barangkali mbalekno hondae.\n\nexact disappear perhaps N-return-3sg Honda-that\n\n‘(He’s) completely disappeared, (he’s) probably returning a/the motorbike.’\n\n(Rafferty, 1982: 44)\n\n(10)\n\nSuru ditumbok sebelume pagi, sebelume makan itu diminum.\n\nask di-mash before-it morning, before-it eat that di-drink\n\n‘(She) told me to mash (it), and in the morning, before eating, to drink (it).’\n\n(Rafferty, 1982: 46)\n\nHopper (1979) has also argued that the Indonesian-type language Early Modern Malay had a distinction between imperfective and perfective clauses. However, he argues that the aspectual distinctions are a result of some clauses being foregrounding, i.e. they are central to the development of the narrative and are perfective, and some clauses being backgrounding, i.e. they provide information that supports, but is not central to, the main events of the narrative and are imperfective. He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\n(92)\n\nInyo (*mam-)pai surang.\n\n3 (*AV-)go ONE-person\n\n‘He went alone.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(93)\n\nAden suko (*mang-)kalua malam minggu.\n\n1\n\nlike (*AV-)go.out\n\nnight week\n\n‘I like going out on Saturday nights.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNevertheless, active transitive forms can be derived from these verbs with the use of the applicative -an. Only then can these lexically bare stems combine with the active voice prefix.

In a typical transitive clause an active transitive verb root functions as the head and is marked by the active voice prefix maN-. Adjuncts do not form part of the predicate’s core argument structure and are marked by a preposition. Like active intransitives, active transitive predicates can be marked by the active voice marker maN-. Example (96) illustrates a canonical active transitive clause with the active transitive predicate mancuci, ‘wash’. Notice that sabun, ‘soap’, is marked by the preposition jo because it is an adjunct.\n\n(96)\n\nInyo mancuci tangannyo jo sabun.\n\n3 AV-wash hand-3\n\nwith soap\n\n‘He washed his hands with soap.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\niii.\n\nDek sapatu ko\n\nkaki den sakik.\n\nCAUSE shoe DEM:prox foot 1sg hurt\n\n‘These shoes hurt my feet.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n137\n\n\fe. *Paman awak digadangan.\n\nuncle 1\n\nPV-big-APP\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAll passive voice verbs are necessarily bivalent since they require an undergoer and an actor, although not all arguments are necessarily overtly expressed in the clause (see examples (177), (178), and (179)).

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c).

This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11.

Flagging covers any kind of argument marking on the argument itself (e.g. by case or adposition marking). The marking can be phonologically free or bound. The marking of [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P)) arguments is not relevant for establishing whether there is any ergative flagging or not, it is the difference between S and A flagging that results in 1. \nIn case of split flagging systems (specifically, split ergativity), code as 1 if any of the subsystems (e.g. only nouns or only pronouns, or a particular tense or person) shows ergative alignment. Note that although alignment types are occasionally associated with entire languages (e.g. when one says that \"Dyirbal is an ergative language\"), they in fact apply only to individual constructions.

Consider only the major predicate class, ignore any verbs with non-canonical/special flagging (e.g. the so-called ‘dative-subject’ or experiencer verbs). Consider only independent clauses.\n3. Code 0 if there is never overt flagging of any of the three arguments S, A, and P.\n4. Code 0 if S and A are always flagged identically, this includes cases with no overt flagging (i.e. zero marking).\n5. If there is a special flag for A, check whether it is used in all contexts. In particular, be aware of differences in flagging conditioned by a pronoun vs. noun distinction, person, animacy, definiteness, etc. (this situation is generally known as differential argument marking and in case of differential A marking as split ergativity). Code 1 even if only some pronouns or only some nouns (e.g. the inanimate ones) are flagged differently when they are A arguments. If, however, a small random class of nouns does not take a particular flagging for phonological or morphological reasons, ignore this class.\n6.

In some cases polite pronouns are used to indicate a level of formality or unfamiliarity between speaker and addressee.

If multiple second person pronoun forms exist in a single number category, and their use is patterned according to the level of intimacy or hierarchy of social relationship between speaker and addressee, this will suffice for a 1 code. The contrastive forms may or may not have other uses (e.g. in French the form *tu* is used only for second person singular informal, while *vous* is used for both second person singular polite and second person plural); a politeness distinction triggers a 1 for this feature regardless of whether the relevant forms have other functions/meanings.\n\n",

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one.

Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT).

Further investigation is required to test this. However, a similar opposition also exists between the Standard Indonesian causative prefix per- and the applicative -kan. Alwi et al (1998) argue that the perverbs express an increase in the quality named by the stative verb root whereas the -kan verbs describe a complete change of state. So in Indonesian these two affixes encode similar processes: per- focuses on the origin of the event whereas -kan shows its end point.\nIn examples (203) to (206) the function of the prefix pa- is less easy to predict. In these examples pa- has a different semantic effect when it affixes to active verb roots aja, ‘teach’, duduak, ‘sit’, tagak, ‘stand’, and cuci, ‘wash’. The effect of applicative marking on each of these verbs is also different and this also has an effect on how pa- interacts with the applicatives.",

The opposition between iko and itu is much like the difference between ‘this’ and ‘that’ in English.

Firstly, paN- and its correspondences do not refer to the location where the action or event takes place. An exception to this is IBN paN- which, as the only nominalising affix in IBN, has generalised its meaning in a maximal way. Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT). Fourthly, the syntactical role of SM paN- and MIN paN- is quite different from the (more restricted) role of their correspondences in other isolects. This fact is very important for the reconstruction of a PM ancestor, because for SM\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nb.

Inyo mampaelokan otonyo.\n3 AV-CST-good-APP car-3\n‘He is fixing his car.’\n(Elicitation)\nMinangkabau speakers perceive subtle semantic differences between each of these variants of the causative verbs shown in (201) and (202), which may be due to the fact that pa- is concerned with the origin of the action and the applicative -an is concerned with the termination of the action (see Section 5.3). Further investigation is required to test this. However, a similar opposition also exists between the Standard Indonesian causative prefix per- and the applicative -kan. Alwi et al (1998) argue that the perverbs express an increase in the quality named by the stative verb root whereas the -kan verbs describe a complete change of state. So in Indonesian these two affixes encode similar processes: per- focuses on the origin of the event whereas -kan shows its end point.\nIn examples (203) to (206) the function of the prefix pa- is less easy to predict. In these examples pa- has a different semantic effect when it affixes to active verb roots aja, ‘teach’, duduak, ‘sit’, tagak, ‘stand’, and cuci, ‘wash’. The effect of applicative marking on each of these verbs is also different and this also has an effect on how pa- interacts with the applicatives.\n"

                "content": "On the basis of what is commonly found in SM, MIN, BH, and SWY, it is possible to reconstruct for -an(l) a PM ancestor which denoted plurality of subject, or diffuse action on the basis of VDIs, reciprocity when suffixed to VTRs, and collectivity and/or similarity when suffixed to nouns. One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT. Solution (4) yields more perspectives, because it fits in with the fact that JKT -an(l) also seems to be borrowed. Furthermore, JKT has only two suffixes",

            "summary": "This feature targets a specific type of adnominal possessive construction, namely one where a possessor (either nominal or pronominal) is marked with a [suffix or enclitic](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Affixes-and-clitics) to indicate possession of an object. This frequently takes the form of a genitive suffix on a possessor, but may also involve other types of suffixes or enclitics. Crucially, the possession must be marked by an element that follows and is [phonologically bound](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) to the possessor noun/pronoun.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Code 1 if there is an adnominal possessive construction marked by an element which is phonologically bound  to the possessor noun phrase or pronoun, and which follows that noun/pronoun.\n2. Code 0 if there is no adnominal possession construction in which a suffix or enclitic on the possessor noun/pronoun functions to mark possession.\n3.

One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT.

Firstly, paN- and its correspondences do not refer to the location where the action or event takes place. An exception to this is IBN paN- which, as the only nominalising affix in IBN, has generalised its meaning in a maximal way. Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT).

Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking. \n\nThere are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle.

If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing a mood, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.\n\nWhile negation or interrogation can be considered as grammatical moods, they are not included in this feature.\n\n",

If it is not clear whether the marker marks mood, code the language as ?.\n\n",
            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nAs we saw in Section 4.2.1.2, adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood are not encoded morphologically on the verb, rather they are realised as distinct lexical items that precede the verb. These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n(3) It seems that the function that must be attributed to *mAN(].')- is that of agent-oriented verb marker, since this is the function of its reflexes in the isolects. By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-. There are, however, some important reasons not to reconstruct a prefix for this correspondence set:\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nChapter 5 also demonstrated that the active voice marker maN-, as well as the affixes ta-, pa-, and ba-, have lexical/derivational functions.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6).

The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function.

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

            "question": "Can tense be marked by a non-inflecting word (‘auxiliary particle’)?",
            "summary": "This feature covers all tenses (present, past and future) and aims to capture [phonologically free](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) elements that do no inflect (i.e. do not change form depending on person, number and other categories of the core arguments). These markers are often described as ‘[particles](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Particles)’ in the literature, but are also analyzed under other labels. We are interested in grammatical marking, i.e. [dedicated](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Dedicated-marking), [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) marking. This means that words such as ‘tomorrow’ and ‘yesterday’ do not qualify as productively marking future and hesternal past.\n\nThere are instances where TAM can be expressed by a combination of an affix and auxiliary or particle. For example, some grammarians state that tense is expressed by a certain form on the verbal root and an auxiliary. If this is a [productive](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Productivity) and [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) way of expressing mood then such a construction triggers 1 for both this feature (GB521) and the features on bound mood marking ([GB082](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB082)/[GB083](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB083)/[GB084](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB084)). If not all parts of the discontinuous marking are necessary for expressing a tense, then only consider the marking that is obligatory.\n\n",
            "procedure": "1. Look up the sections on tense marking in the grammatical description.\n2. Consider all marking of tense, e.g. not only past.\n3. If you do not find any non-inflecting phonologically free tense markers, code as 0.\n4. If there is a non-inflecting phonologically free marker that clearly marks tense, code the language as 1.\n5. If it is not clear whether the marker marks tense, code the language as ?.\n\n",
            "context": "To help answer the question, here is relevant data retrieved from a grammar book\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/adelaar_proto-malayic1992v2_o.txt'}\n155\nhad an excessive meaning, which later on weakened into superlative in SM and SWY, and into comparative in BH. Positing an original excessive meaning has the advantage of putting the origin of tor- etc. + VSIs more in line with for- etc. + VTRs, VDIs or precategorials (i.e. with tor- with an unintentional meaning). This means that only one PM prefix would need to be reconstructed for both, with an unintentional and excessive meaning combined with a potential one; this prefix would have occurred with all verbs (VSIs, VDIs, VTRs, precategorials). But with the evidence at hand it is safer to limit oneself to what can actually be reconstructed with certainty. That is a PM prefix *tAr-, which occurred at least with VTRs and VDIs (including precategorials), and which conveyed the notion of unintentionality and potentiality. The subject of a *£Ar- form was either object or (involuntary) agent of the performance.\n6.2.8 Reconstruction of *tAr-\nI reconstruct *£Ar-, which contributed the notion of unintentionality or feasibility to the VTR or VDI to which it was affixed. It is unclear whether *tAr- also occurred on the basis of VSIs (with the meaning of a degree marker).\n6.3 The FOCUS-MARKING AFFIXES moN(l)-, 0-, AND di-, AND THE INTRANSITIVE VERBAL PREFIX maN(2)-, AND THEIR CORRESPONDENCES\n6.3.1 SM\nPrentice distinguishes mə/v(l)- and maN(2)- in SM: mə/v(l)- is an (inflectional) transitive verbal prefix indicating orientation towards the agent of an action, mə/v(l)- corresponds to 0 and di-:\n0 applies when the verb is object-oriented and the agent is a first or second person (which includes verbs in the imperative mood);189\ndi- is prefixed to object-oriented verbs, when the agent is a third person.190\nExamples:\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nThree TAM adverbials, nio, alah and alun, are exemplified in examples (46), (47) and (48) respectively. Notice that the TAM markers precede the verb in all examples.\n\n(46)\n\nInyo duduak karano nio makan.\n\n3 sit\n\nbecause want eat\n\n‘He sat down because he wanted to eat.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(47)\n\nAlah dipotongnyo cimangko?\n\nPFCT PV-cut-3\n\nwatermelon\n\n‘Has the watermelon been cut up yet?’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(48)\n\nAlun ujan ari ko.\n\nnot.yet rain day DEM:dist\n\n‘It hasn’t rained yet today.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n70\n\n\fAccording to Anderson (1985), aktionsart can also be a formal or semantic property of verbs. In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.\n{'source': 'resources/minangkabau/crouch_minangkabau2009.txt'}\nDowty, David R. 1979.
