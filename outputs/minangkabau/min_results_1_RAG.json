In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

                "content": "thus equating them with adjectives, or do we negate both the operators, describing them as [-noun, -verb] and leaving no way of distinguishing them from adpositions? What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Nasalisation of actor-oriented verbs, affixation of the nominalising affixes paN- and paNan, yield the following alternations:\n\n(1) velar nasal accretion for initial vowels, e.g.\n\n(adil): (ikat): (ukur):\n\nŋadili ‘give judgement’, paŋadilan ‘law court’ rpkat‘bind’, pəŋikat‘s.th. to bind’ ŋukur‘measure’, pəŋukur‘measurer, gauger’\n\n(2) homorganic nasal substitution for initial stops, e.g.\n\n(potfi(h)): (pikul): (bali): (buka7): (dagax): (dapat): (timbo): (tufijiP7): (cukur): (jaliŋ): (jait): (kapur) (in (kildr): (gundal): (gantuŋ):\n\nHelfrich\n\nkapux):\n\nmotp(h) ‘make white’ pamikul ‘s.o. carrying a yoke’ mali ‘buy’ pəmuka 7 ‘entrepreneur’ nayax ‘hear’ pənapat ‘opinion’ nimbo ‘bale (water)’ pənunju37 ‘pointer’ nukiir ‘shave’, pafiukur ‘barber’ nəliŋ ‘look sidelong, squint’ panait ‘dressmaker, n*eedle ŋapur ‘whitewash’ pərpjdr‘a file’ ŋundali ‘throw at (s.th.)’ pəŋantuŋan ‘place to hang s.th.’\n\nN.B. As the above examples show, in Aliana et al. stops become homorganic nasals. Helfrich, however, is vague about the exact nature of nasalisation of stops, but from his examples it appears that voiceless stops usually become homorganic nasals, and that voiced stops usually have homorganic nasal accretion. Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

However, the uses of maN- with verbal roots are predictable whereas the semantics of maN- verbs derived from nominal roots are quite difficult to predict. The examples in (288) demonstrate this. Although the derived verbal forms all share active semantics, the conceptual framework for each of the events is quite different. First, the transitivity of derived verbal forms is not predictable. For example, (288d) is intransitive whereas the other verbs are transitive. This indicates that some elements of the argument structure of nominal roots are specified in the lexicon. One can also not predict what kind of activity the nominal root entails. According to Moussay (1998) maN- derives verbs meaning ‘to use noun’ from nominal roots. The verb manggandang, ‘beat on the drum’, is clearly an example of this type. In addition, Adelaar (1992a) finds that nouns can also form intransitive maN- verbs meaning ‘to be on noun’. Based on the examples in (288) we can also add ‘to send noun to someone’ (manesemes), ‘to put noun on something’ (mancat), and ‘to make noun’ (manggulai), to the list.

Jacobson, 1979; Swadesh, 1939), Salishan languages (cf. Jelinek and Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) and Polynesian languages (cf. Broschart, 1997; Mosel and Hovdhaugen, 1992) are said to lack a noun-verb distinction; therefore it cannot be said that the primitive features [±noun] and [±verb] are underlying in these languages. Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52",

There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf.

Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot.

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation.

He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers.

However, the pervasive use of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau have meant that the properties that make the P2 construction distinct in Standard Minangkabau do not apply in Colloquial Minangkabau. In fact, the evidence suggests that the P2 construction has merged with the bare active construction in the Colloquial variety.\n\nAs described in Section 5.1.4, the P2 construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau has a restrictive set of word order constraints. In Standard Minangkabau, nothing must intervene between the actor and the verb in a P2 clause, therefore all auxiliaries (i.e. negators and TAM adverbials) must precede the actor, whereas in a Standard Minangkabau active sentence, auxiliaries can intervene between the actor and the verb. In fact, if these clausal components occurred before the actor NP, then the sentence’s acceptability would be very much reduced. We do not find these word order constraints in Colloquial Minangkabau and in fact find that clauses with bare verbs allow both ‘auxiliary + actor’ and ‘actor + auxiliary’ word orders.\n\nFor example, consider the sentences in (266) which show that there are no constraints on the ordering of the actor NP and the auxiliary components in an active clause.\n\n(266) a. b. c.\n\nInyo acok ubah gayanyo.\n3 often change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo ubah gayanyo.\noften 3 change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo maubah gayanyo.\noften 3 AV-change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\n(Elicitation)\n\n199",

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.",

As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

For these predicates, I argue that ba- functions to mark middle voice. These middle predicates are intransitive but it is clear that the actor also undergoes some change, so in this sense they are broadly reflexive. Middle voice in Minangkabau resembles the middle voice of Greek which is used to mark transitive predicates that are somewhere between an active and a passive, or intransitive predicates that have a passive like relation to their subject (Bakker, 1994). In fact, the reflexive and reciprocal predicates can also be described as middle constructions since the action does not extend beyond the sphere of the actor. According to Croft’s (1991; 1994) event-based framework for voice phenomena, reflexives and reciprocals have the same event frame as middle verbs since they involve a situation in which the subject is both the initiator and end point of the action.\n\nCross-linguistically, the middle voice is associated with a number of situation types that involve similar aktionsart and event properties. Based on Talmy’s (1972) classification of event types, Kemmer (1994: 181-83) lists ten middle situation types that might involve middle marking in languages that have a middle voice. Kemmer’s middle situation types are listed in Table 19.\n\n164\n\n\fTable 19.

In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity. Clauses with N- marked verbs were irrealis, stative, off the timeline of the main narrative events, and more likely to have non-referential patients. Clauses with di- marked verbs, on the other hand, were\n26\n\n\findicative, eventive, and on the timeline of the main narrative events.

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation.

Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument.

Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data.

They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language.

Cases of multifunctionality abound in Minangkabau morphology and the language’s lexical/derivational affixes ta-, pa- and ba- are particularly multifunctional (see Section 5.2). The correlations between the syntactic and semantic properties of the root and the meaning or syntactic function of the affix being profiled are relatively transparent. For example, ta- derives superlative forms only from stative roots and creates stative ‘ability’ predicates only from transitive verb roots. Nevertheless it remains difficult to clarify the exact correlations between the category of the root and the intended use of the affix in a number of other cases, for example the causative marker pa- when it occurs with non-stative roots (see Section 5.2.2).",

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively.

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot.

Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb. In (51c) the prefixation of the active voice marker maN- creates a change of state verb from the root word and in (51d) the addition of the applicative –an derives a transitive, causative verb.\n\n(51) a.\n\nBaju itame tu\n\nnan gaek-gaek tu.\n\nshirt black-3 DEM:dist REL RED-old DEM:dist\n\n‘The old people wear black shirts.’\n\n(Text ID: 445038115055260406)\n73",

A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

This meant that their answer would then provide contrastive focus between the two possible answers. In (113b) the answer Udin is given, but this answer should be understood in context; i.e. it was Udin that bought the new car (rather than somebody else). Since the answer Udin provides contrastive focus, this means that Udin the NP is referentially salient and therefore selected as the pivot. This in turn triggers active voice marking on the verb since Udin is an actor. Notice that although (113c) is grammatically well formed, in this context it is infelicitous (as shown by the # symbol).

This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2).

It should, however, be pointed out that MIN a could also be a contraction of an earlier +aha. This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2). Alongside *si-apa *sai ‘id.’ is also reconstructed on the basis of KD sad; it is not found elsewhere in the Malayic group, but cf. PMP *sa(y)i ‘id.’.",

For example, he suggests that a root like bigay, ‘give’, will specify the conceptual paradigm ‘giving by X of Y to Z’, but will not specify how X, Y and Z’s semantic roles map onto argument structure. The role of voice morphology is then to specify how the semantic roles specified by the root’s conceptual structure ought to be realised syntactically. To do this, the root must first become a verb. So, according to Foley, voice morphology actually performs a single derivational process: deriving a verb from a precategorial root and selecting a specific semantic role as the pivot.\nSince argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, according to Foley (1998; 2008) this means that there is no preference as to which of the participants entailed by the root’s conceptual structure gets realised as the pivot. This, he argues, shows that no one voice type is basic and that voice in Philippine-type languages is ‘symmetrical’ (see Section 2.1). Naturally, precategoriality and symmetrical voice systems are complementary features and it is these features, he argues, that are typologically salient in Philippine-type languages.\nNevertheless, whether Philippine-type languages are precategorial or not is still a matter of debate and a number of alternate analyses have been put forward. Two of these alternate analyses are discussed here. First, we will examine Kroeger’s (1998) argument against precategoriality, and second, we will discuss Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) proposal that the morphology of Philippine-type languages is multifunctional.",

Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers.

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

Nasalisation of actor-oriented verbs, affixation of the nominalising affixes paN- and paNan, yield the following alternations:\n\n(1) velar nasal accretion for initial vowels, e.g.\n\n(adil): (ikat): (ukur):\n\nŋadili ‘give judgement’, paŋadilan ‘law court’ rpkat‘bind’, pəŋikat‘s.th. to bind’ ŋukur‘measure’, pəŋukur‘measurer, gauger’\n\n(2) homorganic nasal substitution for initial stops, e.g.\n\n(potfi(h)): (pikul): (bali): (buka7): (dagax): (dapat): (timbo): (tufijiP7): (cukur): (jaliŋ): (jait): (kapur) (in (kildr): (gundal): (gantuŋ):\n\nHelfrich\n\nkapux):\n\nmotp(h) ‘make white’ pamikul ‘s.o. carrying a yoke’ mali ‘buy’ pəmuka 7 ‘entrepreneur’ nayax ‘hear’ pənapat ‘opinion’ nimbo ‘bale (water)’ pənunju37 ‘pointer’ nukiir ‘shave’, pafiukur ‘barber’ nəliŋ ‘look sidelong, squint’ panait ‘dressmaker, n*eedle ŋapur ‘whitewash’ pərpjdr‘a file’ ŋundali ‘throw at (s.th.)’ pəŋantuŋan ‘place to hang s.th.’\n\nN.B. As the above examples show, in Aliana et al. stops become homorganic nasals. Helfrich, however, is vague about the exact nature of nasalisation of stops, but from his examples it appears that voiceless stops usually become homorganic nasals, and that voiced stops usually have homorganic nasal accretion. Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

It should, however, be pointed out that MIN a could also be a contraction of an earlier +aha. This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2).

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot.

The origin of BH nag is also uncertain.\nSWY no is probably a secondary development of the third person possessive pronoun. Finally, the origin of IBN ti and kə are obscure; ti must be a contracted form, since in MUA tay (written ‘tai’) is found. No attempt at a reconstruction is made (the lack of comparative agreement makes it quite likely that PM did not have a relative clause marker).\n5.5.2.4 INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS Along with full interrogative pronouns, MIN has a series of short forms (a, ma, bar/a etc.,\nwritten ‘a’, ‘ma’, ‘bara’ etc. in Van der Toorn). *apa ‘what (interrogative)’ was reconstructed on the basis of reflexes in all isolects (3.1.1.4; IBN has apa (< SM or SAR?) besides nama). *mana( ?) ‘which’ is reconstructed on the basis of regular correspondences in all isolects but IBN. It should, however, be pointed out that MIN a could also be a contraction of an earlier +aha. This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2). Alongside *si-apa *sai ‘id.’ is also reconstructed on the basis of KD sad; it is not found elsewhere in the Malayic group, but cf. PMP *sa(y)i ‘id.’.",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-. Foregrounding clauses were also more likely to be perfective, and backgrounding clauses to be imperfective.

In (11) we see an example of active voice used in a clause containing background information.

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

This is supported by examples where the intended semantic roles of the verb's arguments can be understood from the context without phonological expression, reflecting a feature of Colloquial Minangkabau discourse where ambiguity is acceptable.",

But perhaps in these cases the speaker doesn’t intend anything, therefore the hearer has no need to disambiguate in the first place. Perhaps bare verb constructions don’t represent some kind of defective or underspecified version of a voice marked verb construction. Instead, they are used in cases where voice and semantic roles are not just underspecified, but unimportant. This is because ambiguity is a perfectly acceptable feature of Colloquial Minangkabau discourse. Gil (2002a; 2006) explores similar ideas\n211",
