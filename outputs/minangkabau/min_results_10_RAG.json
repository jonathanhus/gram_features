Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source). Nor do I have an explanation for the IBN demonstratives (note their agreement with Tagalog, which has itð referring to things close to the speaker).",

Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT).

If we apply Croft’s logic to the Minangkabau case, this would suggest that roots do not have inherent functions. Because nouns and verbs can function in nonprototypical ways without any changes to their surface forms, these roots are not inherently nominal or verbal, some roots are just more likely to occur in nominal or verbal position due to their semantics. If we take this hypothesis to its extreme, a possible conclusion is that Minangkabau roots are precategorial; that is, categories can be defined on the basis of the construction type and lexemes do not have any ‘underlying’ category membership; they acquire nominal or verbal status only when they are used in a nominal or verbal construction.\nSimilar questions have been raised about the categorical status of roots and the role of voice morphology in other Austronesian languages, particularly Philippine-type\n212",

Since kə- -an(V) and ter- etc. are to a great extent similar in function and meaning, a difference in distribution would be expected between them.

In BH, ka- -an(2) is found with VDIs, but here the resulting noun exclusively refers to the place where the action is performed.

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source).

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

This had led some linguists to propose that roots in Philippine-type languages are precategorial. That is to say, distinctions between nominal and verbal parts of speech are not made in the lexicon, instead the distinctions depend on the syntactic and morphological frames in which the roots are used. A summary of the arguments that have been made for and against a precategorial analysis of Philippine-type languages are presented in Section 6.3.1. The arguments are then applied to the Minangkabau case and it will be demonstrated that there is indeed evidence to support a categorisation of roots at the lexical level, and that the language is therefore not precategorial.\n6.3 Some Theoretical Solutions\n6.3.1 Precategoriality\nIn this section I will first discuss Foley’s (1998; 2008) proposal that Philippine-type languages are precategorial.

One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT. Solution (4) yields more perspectives, because it fits in with the fact that JKT -an(l) also seems to be borrowed. Furthermore, JKT has only two suffixes",

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source).

In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives.

Jacobson, 1979; Swadesh, 1939), Salishan languages (cf. Jelinek and Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) and Polynesian languages (cf. Broschart, 1997; Mosel and Hovdhaugen, 1992) are said to lack a noun-verb distinction; therefore it cannot be said that the primitive features [±noun] and [±verb] are underlying in these languages. Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52",

According to Langacker, nouns involve summary scanning; we need only to glance at an object summarily in order to tell what kind of object it is. Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way. He argues that verbs, on the other hand, involve change over time, therefore we supposedly perceive events in a sequential way; a snapshot view of a person mid-motion will not tell us if that person is standing, jumping, running, falling or involved in any number of other\n54",

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes.

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1).

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source).

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one.

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

For example, Minangkabau has a class of words that are notionally like adjectives but formally like verbs. So, like Langacker, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that parts of speech can be thought of as prototypical categories and that language specific instantiations of categories may fall somewhere within the specified prototypical domain.

Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way.

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

For example, Minangkabau has a class of words that are notionally like adjectives but formally like verbs. So, like Langacker, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that parts of speech can be thought of as prototypical categories and that language specific instantiations of categories may fall somewhere within the specified prototypical domain. Properties of parts of speech can then be defined in terms of the language\n55",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point. Thus voice marking encodes how the action originates “origin of action”, how the action progresses “development of action”, and how and where the action ends “termination of action” (Shibatani, 2006). For example, transitive actions typically end in the patient being affected, however in some events, the action terminates at a third entity, perhaps a recipient or a benefactor, thus the focus is on the end point of the action. If voice marking encodes this kind of situation type then it can be said to show the “termination of action”. Types of voice marking that fall into this category include benefactives, malefactives and applicatives (Shibatani, 2006: 240). Other types of voice marking used to encode distinctions at each point in the “evolution of action” are listed in Table 16.\n\nTable 16.

OM has three other postcliticised personal pronouns. According to De Casparis -ma:mu is a second person possessive pronoun (De Casparis 1956:35), -ta is “probably a second person polite form” (p.21), and -da (/-nda after vowels) is “a honorific equivalent of na” (p.3).

Compare anak-da or ana-nda, ibu-nda, bapa-nda, cucu-nda, etc. As cliticised pronominal forms were already attested for PMP (Blust 1977a: 11), it is likely that PM had them as well, and that -ma:mu, -ta, and -(n)da are reflexes of these clitics. But it is not clear whether -ma:mu already occurred in PM as a suffix in its present shape or whether it was a complex form which developed into a single suffix after PM.

The MIN and BH forms are problematic: they may have have developed from a morphologically complex pre-PM form *i-ni-ia, or from a (post-?) PM combination *ia + *na with contraction of *ia to i (or to a in MIN ano/ano; pronouns are often subject to irregular shortening and contraction), cf. SM diana ‘(3rd pers. sg./pl.)’ (Gerth van Wijk p.221; Klinkert). *ia was reconstructed for the third person singular (3.4.2.6), which is also in agreement with PMP *si-ia (Blust 1977a: 11).\nA cliticised form of the third person is SM, BH -na, MIN -no/-no/-o/-e; in IBN the full form is used. SM, MIN, BH, SWY, and JKT reflect *-na; the PMP ancestral form of *-na is *ni-a (Blust 1977a:10-l 1) in which a merger of the alveolar nasal with following *i into a palatal nasal had not yet taken place. Some isolects have a third person plural pronoun. One of these, IBN sida?, reflects PMP *si-iDa (Blust 1977a: 11), and PM *sida ? is reconstructed.\nThe other pronouns are later developments: SM məreka (itu)/marika (itu) does not occur in early Classical Malay texts, nor does it have correspondences in other isolects that are not felt to be originally SM. Marika is described as ‘a people’ in Howison (1801) and as ‘people, persons; an armour-bearer, esquire’ in Marsden (1812). It may be borrowed from Old Javanese, which has marika, an emphatic article which apparently also functioned as a*\nvery likely, but the connection of b- with +(a)ba is too conjectural.

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source). Nor do I have an explanation for the IBN demonstratives (note their agreement with Tagalog, which has itð referring to things close to the speaker).",

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

SWY dio, JKT die may originally have had a distribution parallel to that of SM dia; it is also possible that they were borrowed from SM. The MIN and BH forms are problematic: they may have have developed from a morphologically complex pre-PM form *i-ni-ia, or from a (post-?) PM combination *ia + *na with contraction of *ia to i (or to a in MIN ano/ano; pronouns are often subject to irregular shortening and contraction), cf. SM diana ‘(3rd pers. sg./pl.)’ (Gerth van Wijk p.221; Klinkert). *ia was reconstructed for the third person singular (3.4.2.6), which is also in agreement with PMP *si-ia (Blust 1977a: 11).\nA cliticised form of the third person is SM, BH -na, MIN -no/-no/-o/-e; in IBN the full form is used. SM, MIN, BH, SWY, and JKT reflect *-na; the PMP ancestral form of *-na is *ni-a (Blust 1977a:10-l 1) in which a merger of the alveolar nasal with following *i into a palatal nasal had not yet taken place. Some isolects have a third person plural pronoun. One of these, IBN sida?, reflects PMP *si-iDa (Blust 1977a: 11), and PM *sida ? is reconstructed.\nThe other pronouns are later developments: SM məreka (itu)/marika (itu) does not occur in early Classical Malay texts, nor does it have correspondences in other isolects that are not felt to be originally SM. Marika is described as ‘a people’ in Howison (1801) and as ‘people, persons; an armour-bearer, esquire’ in Marsden (1812). It may be borrowed from Old Javanese, which has marika, an emphatic article which apparently also functioned as a*\nvery likely, but the connection of b- with +(a)ba is too conjectural.

The vowel difference in the pair əŋkaw and dikaw raises the question whether *agkau( 7), *kau( 7), or *ikau( 7) must be reconstructed. Both *agkau(7) and *ikau( 7) would result in SM əŋkaw, the latter after (1) antepenultimate neutralisation and (2) nasal insertion between initial ə and following stop (4.2 + fn.128). In each case the last vowel wotɪld have become a diphthong to yield a disyllabic form. But an original *agkau( 7) cannot account for dikaw, nor for MIN kau ‘you (to women)’ or BH kau ‘you’ (Asfandi Adul) 1976:145-146); dikaw must have developed from ^ikauC7) (with diphthongisation of *-au-, and prefixation of *(d)i-), or from *kau( 7) (with prefixation of *di-, and subsequent diphthongisation of *-au-). But the reconstruction of ^ikauC7) assumes (unexplained) loss of the initial vowel in MIN and BH (where kau occurs).\nMost likely, *kau( 7) was the ancestor of SM əŋ/kaw, di/kaw, MIN, BH kau, and SM əŋ/kaw acquired an epenthetic aN- after its disyllabicity was lost in fast speech.\n\n5.5.1.1 First person\n\n*aku ‘(1st pers. sg.)’ was reconstructed on the basis of evidence from four isolects\n\n(3.4.2.6).

Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT. Solution (4) yields more perspectives, because it fits in with the fact that JKT -an(l) also seems to be borrowed. Furthermore, JKT has only two suffixes",

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source).

In (65a) ba- is affixed to duo to indicate that the pivot nyo is in a state of ‘twoness’.

SWY dio, JKT die may originally have had a distribution parallel to that of SM dia; it is also possible that they were borrowed from SM. The MIN and BH forms are problematic: they may have have developed from a morphologically complex pre-PM form *i-ni-ia, or from a (post-?) PM combination *ia + *na with contraction of *ia to i (or to a in MIN ano/ano; pronouns are often subject to irregular shortening and contraction), cf. SM diana ‘(3rd pers. sg./pl.)’ (Gerth van Wijk p.221; Klinkert). *ia was reconstructed for the third person singular (3.4.2.6), which is also in agreement with PMP *si-ia (Blust 1977a: 11).\nA cliticised form of the third person is SM, BH -na, MIN -no/-no/-o/-e; in IBN the full form is used. SM, MIN, BH, SWY, and JKT reflect *-na; the PMP ancestral form of *-na is *ni-a (Blust 1977a:10-l 1) in which a merger of the alveolar nasal with following *i into a palatal nasal had not yet taken place.

One of these, IBN sida?, reflects PMP *si-iDa (Blust 1977a: 11), and PM *sida ? is reconstructed.\nThe other pronouns are later developments: SM məreka (itu)/marika (itu) does not occur in early Classical Malay texts, nor does it have correspondences in other isolects that are not felt to be originally SM. Marika is described as ‘a people’ in Howison (1801) and as ‘people, persons; an armour-bearer, esquire’ in Marsden (1812). It may be borrowed from Old Javanese, which has marika, an emphatic article which apparently also functioned as a*\nvery likely, but the connection of b- with +(a)ba is too conjectural. Beta and beita may be analysed as a derivation from an (unidentified) element *bA + *ita.",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function.

Gil (2000: 192) argues that similar constructions\n63\n\n\fin Malay, for example rumah Bobok, ‘Bobok’s house’ are in fact nominative attributive constructions. This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively. The opposition between iko and itu is much like the difference between ‘this’ and ‘that’ in English. Example (34) shows the use of the demonstrative tu, which is marking the noun gambar, ‘picture’.\n\n(34)\n\nInyo nan mambuek gambar tu.\n\n3 REL AV-make picture DEM:dist\n\n‘He was the one who drew that picture.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

In this example the comparative marker labiah, ‘more’, on pendek, ‘short’, is missing but the interpretation shorter is still available. The comparative reading relies on the presence of the prepositional phrase dari pisau tu.\n\n(80)\n\nPisau ko\n\npendek dari pisau tu.\n\nknife DEM:prox short\n\nfrom knife DEM:dist\n\n‘This knife is shorter than that one.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n89\n\n\fNon-gradable states do no co-occur with comparative markers because they represent inherent polar states. Example (81) illustrates the use of the non-gradable stative predicate mati, ‘dead’. Stative predicates, like all predicate constructions, can be modified by preceding TAM adverbials. In (81) the TAM adverbial alah is used to mark perfective aspect. It is inserted before the stative predicate mati, but after the undergoer, maliang tu, ‘the thief’.\n\n(81)\n\nMaliang tu\n\nalah mati.\n\nthief\n\nDEM:dist PFCT dead\n\n‘The thief died.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAnother feature of stative predicates is that they productively derive active transitive verbs with the addition of active voice morphology and the applicative -an. Most active transitive verbs derived from statives this way will have a causative meaning. In (82) the active transitive verb mandinginan, ‘to cause to be cold’, has been derived by adding the active voice prefix maN- and the applicative -an to the stative root dingin.\n\n(82)\n\nAmbo mandinginan gulai.\n\n1sg AV-cold-APP curry\n\n‘I’m cooling down the curry.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”",

Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT).

Stative clauses with inherent physical state predicates have the same clause structure as emotional states but do not have the same special syntactic valence that allows for a second argument to be introduced into the clause.

Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’.

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Because nouns and verbs can function in nonprototypical ways without any changes to their surface forms, these roots are not inherently nominal or verbal, some roots are just more likely to occur in nominal or verbal position due to their semantics. If we take this hypothesis to its extreme, a possible conclusion is that Minangkabau roots are precategorial; that is, categories can be defined on the basis of the construction type and lexemes do not have any ‘underlying’ category membership; they acquire nominal or verbal status only when they are used in a nominal or verbal construction.\nSimilar questions have been raised about the categorical status of roots and the role of voice morphology in other Austronesian languages, particularly Philippine-type\n212",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions.

Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class.

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

As the above examples show, in Aliana et al. stops become homorganic nasals. Helfrich, however, is vague about the exact nature of nasalisation of stops, but from his examples it appears that voiceless stops usually become homorganic nasals, and that voiced stops usually have homorganic nasal accretion. Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.",

Further, the morphophonemic alternations of SM maN(l)-, SM maN(2)-, and their correspondences, and of mere nasalisation, also differ from one isolect to the other. So there are three problems involved in the reconstruction of PM ancestors of SM moN(l)- etc. and SM maN(2)- etc.:\n\n(1) did they have the form mAN- or *N- ?

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

Nouns are also marked for definiteness and deictic status by demonstratives. In terms of the relational properties of nouns, which reflect their syntactic function as described by Andrews (1985), Minangkabau nouns which perform non-core grammatical relations, such as benefactors, instruments, recipients, locations and comitative participants, are marked by specific prepositions. Nouns with core argument status are unmarked but their grammatical relation is determined by their relative position in the clause or by their referential status. In Minangkabau there is no ‘genitive case’ as possession is not marked morphologically. Instead the possessor is encoded as a nominal or pronominal modifier that follows the possessed noun.

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

Crowley, 2002), nor does it have regular diminutive forming processes.\n\nSome examples of these formal properties of Minangkabau nouns follow in examples (27) to (35). Example (27) shows number marking, examples (28) and (29) show how numerical classifiers work, examples (30), (31) and (32) show how possession is marked, example (33) shows how nouns can also be modified by attributive nouns, and examples (34) and (35) show the use of demonstratives.\n\nExample (27) shows a Minangkabau noun that is marked for number. Number is not morphologically marked in Minangkabau, instead numerals precede the noun. Example (27) illustrates this; the noun taun, year, is preceded by the numeral tigo.\n\n(27)\n\nLai tigo taun lebih kurang.\n\nmore three year more less\n\n‘More or less three years ago.’\n\n(Text ID: 979548152848070306)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also marked by numerical classifiers. Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention.

However, the uses of maN- with verbal roots are predictable whereas the semantics of maN- verbs derived from nominal roots are quite difficult to predict. The examples in (288) demonstrate this. Although the derived verbal forms all share active semantics, the conceptual framework for each of the events is quite different. First, the transitivity of derived verbal forms is not predictable. For example, (288d) is intransitive whereas the other verbs are transitive. This indicates that some elements of the argument structure of nominal roots are specified in the lexicon. One can also not predict what kind of activity the nominal root entails. According to Moussay (1998) maN- derives verbs meaning ‘to use noun’ from nominal roots. The verb manggandang, ‘beat on the drum’, is clearly an example of this type. In addition, Adelaar (1992a) finds that nouns can also form intransitive maN- verbs meaning ‘to be on noun’. Based on the examples in (288) we can also add ‘to send noun to someone’ (manesemes), ‘to put noun on something’ (mancat), and ‘to make noun’ (manggulai), to the list.

Also, in these isolects -kan (Kelantan -kɛ) is productive, whereas -i is unproductive and survived only as a fossil.\nCollins compared SM -kan to Banjarese -akan and BAC -akaŋ and akaŋ. He concluded that a preposition *akan has to be reconstructed for this correspondence, and that Banjarese and BAC reflect intermediate stages of the development from this preposition into a suffix as in SM.\nIn Adelaar (1984) I check the findings of both Ras and Collins against evidence from the other isolects. I agree with Ras that SM -kan etc. is younger than SM -i etc., and with Collins that a preposition has to be reconstructed as the PM ancestor of SM -kan. However, this preposition should be *akAn instead of *akan on account of data from languages outside the Malayic group and the fact that PM retained schwa in last syllables (cf.

Thus, for Shibatani, although active voice indicates a pragmatically motivated opposition to passive voice, it also has conceptual underpinnings. The Minangkabau active voice marker maN- also occupies this intersection between semantics and pragmatics and also functions to show the development of an action. In Colloquial Minangkabau the functional load of maN- is primarily semantic since it is not used to mark a pragmatic voice distinction (see Chapter 6).\n\nThere is also evidence to support an analysis of meN- in Malay/Indonesian as a semantic/conceptual device used to mark aspectual notions.

The exact alternations are difficult to trace, but it is likely that the *-N- of this prefix was realised in at least the following ways:\n(a) homorganic nasal accretion before initial voiced stops; (b) homorganic nasal substitution for initial *p, *t, and *k; (c) palatal nasal substitution for initial (d) ŋ before initial nasals and liquids.\n6.4 Evidence from Old Malay and Malayic Dayak\n6.4.1 reconstruction of a pm subjunctive marker *-a?\nKD has a suffix -a7 to which Dunselman (1949:61) attributed a ‘voluntative’ function.

Finally, it may form a comparative degree when suffixed to VSIs. JKT -an(l) in some ways agrees more with -an in neighbouring non-Malayic languages, as has already been pointed out by Ikranagara for -an(l) forming a comparative degree on the basis of VSIs. But in other ways too JKT -an(l) seems to agree more with non-Malayic languages: JV and SUN have VDIs consisting of a noun + -an with the meaning ‘wear, have (noun)’ (cf. JKT jeŋgðtan, etc.), and JV has VDIs consisting of a noun + -ən meaning ‘suffer from (noun)’ (cf. JKT iŋusan, pand7an, kðreŋan, although one would expect an ending -ən instead of -an(l)). Like JKT, JV also has VDIs denoting stativity or durativity (cf. JKT rəbaan, tiduran, eəmbimɪan, and jualan, pəgaŋan) or reciprocity (cf. JKT dəmənan, kənalan) which are formed on the basis of a VDI or VTR + -an.

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

In colloquial contexts, speakers of Minangkabau will often omit the active voice prefix maN-. This means that if a speaker uses a bare form of a stative verb then the difference between a state and a change of state is not explicitly encoded.\n\n(83)\n\nMandingin se udaro ko\n\nyo.\n\nAV-cold\n\njust air\n\nDEM:prox EMPH\n\n‘The weather is getting cold, isn't it?’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n90\n\n\fThe semantics of some active transitive verbs formed from statives are unpredictable. For example in (84) the active transitive verb formed from the state berang, ‘angry’, is not a causative. Instead the form mamberangan, ‘get angry at’, implies that awak is the subject of amak’s anger. Notice that awak does not undergo a change of state like an undergoer in a causative construction would. This behaviour is probably due to berang’s special syntactic valence (see example (76)).\n\n(84)\n\nAmak mamberangan awak.\n\nmum AV-angry-APP 1\n\n‘Mum got angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n4.3.2.2 Active Intransitive Predicates\n\nMinangkabau active intransitive predicates display active aktionsart. Where statives have an undergoer pivot, active intransitives have an actor pivot which typically precedes the verb. The majority of active intransitive verb roots combine productively with the active voice prefix maN-. However, many speakers treat the active voice prefix as optional, especially in informal interaction (see Chapter 6).",

In this case, the prefix changes the inherent aspect of the verb root from a state to an activity. The prefix also licenses an actor argument, which is automatically assigned pivot status since the verb is intransitive. Causative verbs can also be derived from\n\n14 Adelaar (1992a) claims that maN- can also derive intransitive verbs from nouns that mean ‘to be on noun’.

The causative, transitive verb mandinginan, ‘cool something down’, is then derived in (158b) with the addition of the applicative -an.

Although the derived verbal forms all share active semantics, the conceptual framework for each of the events is quite different. First, the transitivity of derived verbal forms is not predictable. For example, (288d) is intransitive whereas the other verbs are transitive. This indicates that some elements of the argument structure of nominal roots are specified in the lexicon. One can also not predict what kind of activity the nominal root entails. According to Moussay (1998) maN- derives verbs meaning ‘to use noun’ from nominal roots. The verb manggandang, ‘beat on the drum’, is clearly an example of this type. In addition, Adelaar (1992a) finds that nouns can also form intransitive maN- verbs meaning ‘to be on noun’. Based on the examples in (288) we can also add ‘to send noun to someone’ (manesemes), ‘to put noun on something’ (mancat), and ‘to make noun’ (manggulai), to the list.

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”",

The maN- prefix also has some lexical/derivational effects, being able to derive active verbs from NPs and stative verbs. The prefix also has semantic effects and adds active aktionsart to the NP roots and stative roots as part of the derivational process. In fact, all maN- verbs have active aktionsart. As such, the semantic effects of maN- can be described in terms of Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework (see below).\n\nWhen combined with a noun, the maN- prefix adds an active aktionsart to the root’s meaning. It can form active intransitive verbs meaning ‘to use noun’ (Moussay, 1998) and can also combine with nominal roots to form transitive verbs14. For example, in (157) the verb maN- derives the verb manggulai, ‘make a curry’, from the NP root gulai, ‘curry’. Notice that the derived verb is transitive: it specifies an actor argument, inyo, ‘she’, the person making the curry, and an undergoer argument, kambiang, ‘goat’, the thing being turned into a curry.\n\n(157)\n\nInyo manggulai kambiang.\n\n3 AV-curry\n\ngoat\n\n‘She’s making a goat curry.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Thus, for Shibatani, although active voice indicates a pragmatically motivated opposition to passive voice, it also has conceptual underpinnings. The Minangkabau active voice marker maN- also occupies this intersection between semantics and pragmatics and also functions to show the development of an action. In Colloquial Minangkabau the functional load of maN- is primarily semantic since it is not used to mark a pragmatic voice distinction (see Chapter 6).\n\nThere is also evidence to support an analysis of meN- in Malay/Indonesian as a semantic/conceptual device used to mark aspectual notions. Hopper’s (1979) work argues that the foregrounding and backgrounding of events in Classical Malay discourse is achieved through voice marking, whereas other languages achieve this through various other strategies including tense-aspect marking on the verb, word order, and\n131",

Notice that the verb is marked by both the proclitic ji, which is co-referential with the (null) agent, and the enclitic geuh, which is coreferential with the undergoer, gopnyan, ‘he’. In Acehnese transitive verbs, the agents are compulsorily referenced by proclitics whereas undergoers are only optionally referenced by enclitics. The presence of undergoer enclitics implies that the undergoer is topical therefore it is rare to have a undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is topical (Durie, 1985a: 201-06). In example (15) the undergoer is indeed topical since the agent is not overtly expressed. Notice also that the undergoer appears before the verb. The ability to appear in pre-verbal position is a property of Core Topics in Acehnese (see below).\n\nSince both active and stative verbs can be either agent oriented or undergoer oriented, Durie (1985a) argues that the split between agent oriented verbs and undergoer oriented verbs is instead defined according to the semantic notions of control and de-control. If a verb takes an agent, the ultimate initiator of the event, it is a controlled verb, whereas if a verb takes an undergoer, the participant that is ultimately affected by the event, then it is a de-controlled verb (Durie, 1985a: 55-56).

The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness.

Jacobson, 1979; Swadesh, 1939), Salishan languages (cf. Jelinek and Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) and Polynesian languages (cf. Broschart, 1997; Mosel and Hovdhaugen, 1992) are said to lack a noun-verb distinction; therefore it cannot be said that the primitive features [±noun] and [±verb] are underlying in these languages. Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52",

Although the derived verbal forms all share active semantics, the conceptual framework for each of the events is quite different. First, the transitivity of derived verbal forms is not predictable. For example, (288d) is intransitive whereas the other verbs are transitive. This indicates that some elements of the argument structure of nominal roots are specified in the lexicon. One can also not predict what kind of activity the nominal root entails. According to Moussay (1998) maN- derives verbs meaning ‘to use noun’ from nominal roots. The verb manggandang, ‘beat on the drum’, is clearly an example of this type. In addition, Adelaar (1992a) finds that nouns can also form intransitive maN- verbs meaning ‘to be on noun’. Based on the examples in (288) we can also add ‘to send noun to someone’ (manesemes), ‘to put noun on something’ (mancat), and ‘to make noun’ (manggulai), to the list.

It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional.

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked.

The prefix also has semantic effects and adds active aktionsart to the NP roots and stative roots as part of the derivational process. In fact, all maN- verbs have active aktionsart. As such, the semantic effects of maN- can be described in terms of Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework (see below).\n\nWhen combined with a noun, the maN- prefix adds an active aktionsart to the root’s meaning.

For example, in (157) the verb maN- derives the verb manggulai, ‘make a curry’, from the NP root gulai, ‘curry’.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds.

We saw in Section 6.1.3 that Minangkabau parts of speech are multifunctional; nouns prototypically function to refer but can also function to predicate and modify; and verbs prototypically function to predicate but can also function to refer and modify. Verbal functions are usually indicated by the presence of verbal morphology, however Section 6.2.1 demonstrated that voice marking on the verb is not obligatory. Therefore we have a set of roots in Minangkabau that can appear in a range of construction types (referential, modificatory, predicative) but that are not differentiated at the morphological level.

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

Minangkabau also has a class of ‘property words’, but since these property words are used to predicate I argue that they represent a sub-type of stative verb. As well as nouns and verbs I also argue that Minangkabau has a class of adverbs, which are discussed in Section 4.2.1.3. Nouns, verbs and adverbs are open class items, but Minangkabau also has a number of closed class items including pronouns, prepositions, specifiers, negators, TAM adverbials and pragmatic particles.

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Jacobson, 1979; Swadesh, 1939), Salishan languages (cf. Jelinek and Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) and Polynesian languages (cf. Broschart, 1997; Mosel and Hovdhaugen, 1992) are said to lack a noun-verb distinction; therefore it cannot be said that the primitive features [±noun] and [±verb] are underlying in these languages. Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52",

Minangkabau also has a class of ‘property words’, but since these property words are used to predicate I argue that they represent a sub-type of stative verb.

Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

                "content": "thus equating them with adjectives, or do we negate both the operators, describing them as [-noun, -verb] and leaving no way of distinguishing them from adpositions? What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

If we apply Croft’s logic to the Minangkabau case, this would suggest that roots do not have inherent functions. Because nouns and verbs can function in nonprototypical ways without any changes to their surface forms, these roots are not inherently nominal or verbal, some roots are just more likely to occur in nominal or verbal position due to their semantics. If we take this hypothesis to its extreme, a possible conclusion is that Minangkabau roots are precategorial; that is, categories can be defined on the basis of the construction type and lexemes do not have any ‘underlying’ category membership; they acquire nominal or verbal status only when they are used in a nominal or verbal construction.\nSimilar questions have been raised about the categorical status of roots and the role of voice morphology in other Austronesian languages, particularly Philippine-type\n212",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

In Minangkabau these questions exist because of the use of bare forms, whereas in Philippine-type languages it is the prevalent use of voice morphology with a range of non-verbal parts of speech that causes the conundrum. This had led some linguists to propose that roots in Philippine-type languages are precategorial. That is to say, distinctions between nominal and verbal parts of speech are not made in the lexicon, instead the distinctions depend on the syntactic and morphological frames in which the roots are used. A summary of the arguments that have been made for and against a precategorial analysis of Philippine-type languages are presented in Section 6.3.1. The arguments are then applied to the Minangkabau case and it will be demonstrated that there is indeed evidence to support a categorisation of roots at the lexical level, and that the language is therefore not precategorial.\n6.3 Some Theoretical Solutions\n6.3.1 Precategoriality\nIn this section I will first discuss Foley’s (1998; 2008) proposal that Philippine-type languages are precategorial. I will then discuss some alternative solutions to the categoriality problem in Philippine-type languages presented by Kroeger (1998) and Himmelmann (2006a; 2008).

Example (27) shows number marking, examples (28) and (29) show how numerical classifiers work, examples (30), (31) and (32) show how possession is marked, example (33) shows how nouns can also be modified by attributive nouns, and examples (34) and (35) show the use of demonstratives.\n\nExample (27) shows a Minangkabau noun that is marked for number.

Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer.

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one.

Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo.

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively.

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

The predicate construction is represented in (39) and described in further detail in Section 4.3.\n(39) Predicate Construction =\n((NP) → (negator) → (TAM) → (voice marking)-PRED-(applicative) → (adverb) → (NP))\nMinangkabau verbs also display many of the formal properties of verbs described by Anderson (1985). These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes. Table 10 lists each of these formal properties of verbs and describes how these properties are realised in Minangkabau.\n67\n\n\fTable 10.

The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb.

Minangkabau also has a class of ‘property words’, but since these property words are used to predicate I argue that they represent a sub-type of stative verb. As well as nouns and verbs I also argue that Minangkabau has a class of adverbs, which are discussed in Section 4.2.1.3. Nouns, verbs and adverbs are open class items, but Minangkabau also has a number of closed class items including pronouns, prepositions, specifiers, negators, TAM adverbials and pragmatic particles.

Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way.

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

According to Langacker, nouns involve summary scanning; we need only to glance at an object summarily in order to tell what kind of object it is. Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way. He argues that verbs, on the other hand, involve change over time, therefore we supposedly perceive events in a sequential way; a snapshot view of a person mid-motion will not tell us if that person is standing, jumping, running, falling or involved in any number of other\n54",

A non-core argument, on the other hand, is “peripheral” in the sense that it is not as syntactically ‘available’ as a core argument. Non-core arguments are typically adjunct-like and their non-core status is often marked by the presence of adpositions (Arka, 2003b).\n\nSo, in contrast to the symmetric passive construction, in Standard Indonesian’s asymmetric passive, the actor argument is syntactically demoted and given non-core status (Arka, 2003b; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). This is marked by the presence of the agentive/causal preposition oleh. An example of this can be seen in (6c) where the actor Sul has been given non-core status and is thus preceded by the preposition oleh.\n\nHowever, in the pasif semu, also referred to as the ‘pseudo passive’, the object voice, or passive type two (hereafter the P2 construction), both actor and undergoer are retained as core arguments (Arka and Manning, 2008; Musgrave, 2000). In the P2 construction, the undergoer is selected as the pivot (cf. Chung, 1976a) and precedes the verb. The P2 verb is not marked for voice but hosts a pronominal proclitic coding the actor. The sentence in (7) shows an example of a P2 construction. In this example notice that the undergoer buku ini, ‘this book’, is the pivot and thus precedes the verb, baca, ‘read’. The first person actor, ku, then appears as a proclitic on the verb.\n\n(7)\n\nBuku ini\n\nsudah ku=baca.\n\nbook DEM:prox PFCT 1sg=read\n\n‘I have read this book.’\n\n(adapted from Sneddon, 1996: 249)",

Kroeger, 1998), Minangkabau does not have any lexical specifications about a verb’s ‘default’ pivot or its basic voice. This idea is supported by the fact that, when bare verbs are used in place of voice marked verbs, the ‘voice’ of the verb and the semantic roles of the verb’s arguments are underspecified (see Section 6.1.2). This suggests that some elements of the verb’s argument structure are dependent on the surface realisation of syntactic structures and voice morphology on the verb. Rather than claiming that the unmarked verb is precategorial, we can propose that some aspects of its argument structure in Minangkabau are underspecified (see Section 6.3.2). We could also propose a solution similar to Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) and argue that some elements of argument structure are specified by the verb root and other elements are specified by the voice marker. The interaction of root with voice marker and the effects that this has on argument structure must depend on the category and semantics of the root.\n6.3.1.2 Nominalisation Processes\nAs discussed in Section 4.2.1.2, Minangkabau has productive nominalising morphology and makes use of three main nominalising affixes: pa-, paN-, and -an. Like many of the nominalising affixes used in Philippine-type languages, two of the Minangkabau nominalisers, pa- and -an, are apparently homophonous with verbal morphological markers: the causative prefix pa- and the applicative -an respectively (see Section 6.3.1.3). The examples in (285) show how pa- and -an affect the verbal roots to create phonologically identical nominal and verbal forms.\n218\n\n\f(285) ROOT\na. tanam b. tolong c. tamu d. ingek\n\n‘plant’ ‘help’ ‘meet’ ‘remember’",

Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988).

For example, he suggests that a root like bigay, ‘give’, will specify the conceptual paradigm ‘giving by X of Y to Z’, but will not specify how X, Y and Z’s semantic roles map onto argument structure. The role of voice morphology is then to specify how the semantic roles specified by the root’s conceptual structure ought to be realised syntactically. To do this, the root must first become a verb. So, according to Foley, voice morphology actually performs a single derivational process: deriving a verb from a precategorial root and selecting a specific semantic role as the pivot.\nSince argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, according to Foley (1998; 2008) this means that there is no preference as to which of the participants entailed by the root’s conceptual structure gets realised as the pivot. This, he argues, shows that no one voice type is basic and that voice in Philippine-type languages is ‘symmetrical’ (see Section 2.1). Naturally, precategoriality and symmetrical voice systems are complementary features and it is these features, he argues, that are typologically salient in Philippine-type languages.\nNevertheless, whether Philippine-type languages are precategorial or not is still a matter of debate and a number of alternate analyses have been put forward. Two of these alternate analyses are discussed here. First, we will examine Kroeger’s (1998) argument against precategoriality, and second, we will discuss Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) proposal that the morphology of Philippine-type languages is multifunctional.",

Non-core arguments can also be assigned core status, and thus become available to be selected as the pivot, with the use of the general applicative -an or the locative applicative -i (see Section 5.3).\n\nTo demonstrate how the core/non-core distinction has an effect on which argument can be selected as the pivot, consider the two verbs agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’. The verb agiah is ditransitive so specifies three arguments as part of its underlying argument structure: an actor, an undergoer and a recipient. However, buek is transitive so only specifies two arguments: an actor and an undergoer, but the use of the applicative -an licenses an additional benefactor participant.\n\nExamples (129) and (130) show the use of these two verbs, agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’, respectively. In (129b) the recipient argument, inyo, ‘him’, (which is marked in bold), is assigned core argument status. This means that it can appear unmarked, i.e. without the preposition ka, in post-verbal position. This also means that if agiah, ‘give’, is marked for passive voice, both the undergoer pitih, ‘money’, and the recipient inyo, ‘him’, are available to be selected as the pivot (see (129c) and (129d)).\n\n(129) a.\n\nAli maagiah pitih ka\nAli AV-give money to\n‘Ali gave money to him.’\n\ninyo.\n3\n\nb.

In Minangkabau, only core arguments can be selected as pivots. The distinction between core and non-core arguments reflects a difference in syntactic status, but it also reflects a difference in their “degree of discourse relevance” (Shibatani, 2006: 261). Core arguments are unmarked and are licensed by the verb’s argument structure. They are also assigned more discourse relevance than non-core arguments. Non-core arguments on the other hand, are not part of the verb’s argument structure and are often accordingly case marked (Foley and Van Valin, 1984: 79). In Minangkabau, non-core arguments are marked by prepositions (see Section 4.2.2.2).\nIn Minangkabau, the argument structure of intransitive verb roots licenses a single core argument: stative verbs license an undergoer whereas active intransitives license an actor. Transitive verb roots license two core arguments: an actor and an undergoer,\n113",

Rather than claiming that the unmarked verb is precategorial, we can propose that some aspects of its argument structure in Minangkabau are underspecified (see Section 6.3.2). We could also propose a solution similar to Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) and argue that some elements of argument structure are specified by the verb root and other elements are specified by the voice marker. The interaction of root with voice marker and the effects that this has on argument structure must depend on the category and semantics of the root.\n6.3.1.2 Nominalisation Processes\nAs discussed in Section 4.2.1.2, Minangkabau has productive nominalising morphology and makes use of three main nominalising affixes: pa-, paN-, and -an. Like many of the nominalising affixes used in Philippine-type languages, two of the Minangkabau nominalisers, pa- and -an, are apparently homophonous with verbal morphological markers: the causative prefix pa- and the applicative -an respectively (see Section 6.3.1.3). The examples in (285) show how pa- and -an affect the verbal roots to create phonologically identical nominal and verbal forms.\n218\n\n\f(285) ROOT\na. tanam b. tolong c. tamu d. ingek\n\n‘plant’ ‘help’ ‘meet’ ‘remember’",

First, there are no clear nominalising processes in Philippine-type languages. All affixes that are used to derive nominal forms can also be used as voice marking affixes, therefore there are no unique nominalising affixes. In addition to this, inflected verb forms can also function as NP heads without any change to their morphological marking. Second, Foley argues that roots do not have an underlying argument structure. If this is the case then this means there is nothing at the lexical level to differentiate verbs from nouns.\n213",

He argues that a Core Role is a participant licensed by the\n34\n\n\fverb’s argument structure that is syntactically ‘available’. Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988).

Jacobson, 1979; Swadesh, 1939), Salishan languages (cf. Jelinek and Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) and Polynesian languages (cf. Broschart, 1997; Mosel and Hovdhaugen, 1992) are said to lack a noun-verb distinction; therefore it cannot be said that the primitive features [±noun] and [±verb] are underlying in these languages. Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52",

As the above examples show, in Aliana et al. stops become homorganic nasals. Helfrich, however, is vague about the exact nature of nasalisation of stops, but from his examples it appears that voiceless stops usually become homorganic nasals, and that voiced stops usually have homorganic nasal accretion. Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.",

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

Kroeger, 1998), Minangkabau does not have any lexical specifications about a verb’s ‘default’ pivot or its basic voice. This idea is supported by the fact that, when bare verbs are used in place of voice marked verbs, the ‘voice’ of the verb and the semantic roles of the verb’s arguments are underspecified (see Section 6.1.2). This suggests that some elements of the verb’s argument structure are dependent on the surface realisation of syntactic structures and voice morphology on the verb. Rather than claiming that the unmarked verb is precategorial, we can propose that some aspects of its argument structure in Minangkabau are underspecified (see Section 6.3.2). We could also propose a solution similar to Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) and argue that some elements of argument structure are specified by the verb root and other elements are specified by the voice marker. The interaction of root with voice marker and the effects that this has on argument structure must depend on the category and semantics of the root.\n6.3.1.2 Nominalisation Processes\nAs discussed in Section 4.2.1.2, Minangkabau has productive nominalising morphology and makes use of three main nominalising affixes: pa-, paN-, and -an. Like many of the nominalising affixes used in Philippine-type languages, two of the Minangkabau nominalisers, pa- and -an, are apparently homophonous with verbal morphological markers: the causative prefix pa- and the applicative -an respectively (see Section 6.3.1.3). The examples in (285) show how pa- and -an affect the verbal roots to create phonologically identical nominal and verbal forms.\n218\n\n\f(285) ROOT\na. tanam b. tolong c. tamu d. ingek\n\n‘plant’ ‘help’ ‘meet’ ‘remember’",

Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

The MIN and BH forms are problematic: they may have have developed from a morphologically complex pre-PM form *i-ni-ia, or from a (post-?) PM combination *ia + *na with contraction of *ia to i (or to a in MIN ano/ano; pronouns are often subject to irregular shortening and contraction), cf. SM diana ‘(3rd pers. sg./pl.)’ (Gerth van Wijk p.221; Klinkert). *ia was reconstructed for the third person singular (3.4.2.6), which is also in agreement with PMP *si-ia (Blust 1977a: 11).\nA cliticised form of the third person is SM, BH -na, MIN -no/-no/-o/-e; in IBN the full form is used. SM, MIN, BH, SWY, and JKT reflect *-na; the PMP ancestral form of *-na is *ni-a (Blust 1977a:10-l 1) in which a merger of the alveolar nasal with following *i into a palatal nasal had not yet taken place. Some isolects have a third person plural pronoun. One of these, IBN sida?, reflects PMP *si-iDa (Blust 1977a: 11), and PM *sida ? is reconstructed.\nThe other pronouns are later developments: SM məreka (itu)/marika (itu) does not occur in early Classical Malay texts, nor does it have correspondences in other isolects that are not felt to be originally SM. Marika is described as ‘a people’ in Howison (1801) and as ‘people, persons; an armour-bearer, esquire’ in Marsden (1812). It may be borrowed from Old Javanese, which has marika, an emphatic article which apparently also functioned as a*\nvery likely, but the connection of b- with +(a)ba is too conjectural.

Nasalisation of actor-oriented verbs, affixation of the nominalising affixes paN- and paNan, yield the following alternations:\n\n(1) velar nasal accretion for initial vowels, e.g.\n\n(adil): (ikat): (ukur):\n\nŋadili ‘give judgement’, paŋadilan ‘law court’ rpkat‘bind’, pəŋikat‘s.th. to bind’ ŋukur‘measure’, pəŋukur‘measurer, gauger’\n\n(2) homorganic nasal substitution for initial stops, e.g.\n\n(potfi(h)): (pikul): (bali): (buka7): (dagax): (dapat): (timbo): (tufijiP7): (cukur): (jaliŋ): (jait): (kapur) (in (kildr): (gundal): (gantuŋ):\n\nHelfrich\n\nkapux):\n\nmotp(h) ‘make white’ pamikul ‘s.o. carrying a yoke’ mali ‘buy’ pəmuka 7 ‘entrepreneur’ nayax ‘hear’ pənapat ‘opinion’ nimbo ‘bale (water)’ pənunju37 ‘pointer’ nukiir ‘shave’, pafiukur ‘barber’ nəliŋ ‘look sidelong, squint’ panait ‘dressmaker, n*eedle ŋapur ‘whitewash’ pərpjdr‘a file’ ŋundali ‘throw at (s.th.)’ pəŋantuŋan ‘place to hang s.th.’\n\nN.B. As the above examples show, in Aliana et al. stops become homorganic nasals. Helfrich, however, is vague about the exact nature of nasalisation of stops, but from his examples it appears that voiceless stops usually become homorganic nasals, and that voiced stops usually have homorganic nasal accretion. Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’.

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

The reasons I give for reconstructing a PM preposition are that in SM a preposition akan still exists and, preceded by a VSI or VDI, is often interchangeable with a derived VTR with -kan (especially in Classical Malay texts). BH -akan still shows the full form of the original preposition (before the loss of *a-). Moreover, BH -akan can also be suffixed to a verb that already has a suffix -i, whereas the opposite (suffixation of -i to a verb that already has -akan) does not occur. Other indications for not reconstructing a suffix is that there is no formal agreement among the correspondences of -kan, cf. SM, MIN -kan, BH -akan, SWY -ka(n)/-kə, IBN -ka, JKT -in. Moreover, IBN -ka is a clitic that still occurs independently in some sources (e.g. Scott 1956), whereas the older suffixes are lost in IBN (it is not improbable that SWY -ka(n)/-kə are also cliticised forms of a preposition kə ‘to(wards); in order to’). JKT -in, which combines the functions of -kan etc. and -i in the other isolects, is formally identical with -in in Balinese (from which it borrowed heavily); it is probably a loan morpheme from Balinese. Finally, there are sometimes formally different correspondences between closely related (sub)dialeets: most regional forms of MIN have -an instead of -kan, and KD, which is very close to IBN, has -atn or -an corresponding to IBN -ka.\nI reconstruct *-i on the basis of SM, MIN, BH, SWY -i, and IBN (fossilised) -/ʃ''.183 *-i was a locative-oriented transitivising suffix; when added to transitive verbal bases, it could also add the notion of multiple action or plurality of object or subject.",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot.

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes.

Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-. There are, however, some important reasons not to reconstruct a prefix for this correspondence set:",

This rule ordering is implicit in the description of the Malayic affixes. For example, in SM, bəsar ‘big’ is a VSI, which becomes nominalised through circumfixation of ka-_-an\\ (kəbəsaran ‘largeness, greatness’); air ‘water’ is a noun. Basar and air become VTRs through suffixation of -kan and -i respectively, and as such they can become abstract nouns, i.e. nouns referring to the act or event as such in the same way as kirim ‘send’ (a VTR), viz. through affixation of poN-_ -an (6.7.3).

There are many shortcomings in the following presentation of the morphology of the six isolects. These are mainly due to the lack of information for some isolects, to the variety of methods used for describing data in the individual isolects, and to the inadequacy of some of these descriptions. The handicaps were felt most in the BH and SWY material, but they also play a role in the treatment of the other isolects.\n\n6.1 Earlier reconstructions\nIn Adelaar (1984) I discussed the transitivising affixes and the intransitive verbal prefixes bər-/ba-/bə- in the Malayic isolects.

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT. Solution (4) yields more perspectives, because it fits in with the fact that JKT -an(l) also seems to be borrowed. Furthermore, JKT has only two suffixes",

Basar and air become VTRs through suffixation of -kan and -i respectively, and as such they can become abstract nouns, i.e. nouns referring to the act or event as such in the same way as kirim ‘send’ (a VTR), viz. through affixation of poN-_ -an (6.7.3). Thus:\n\nadjective\nbasar ‘big’ air ‘water’\n\nverb\nkirim ‘send (O)’ bəsarkan ‘enlarge (O)’ airi ‘irrigate (O)’\n\nnominal derivative\npəŋiriman ‘consignment’ pəmbəsaran ‘enlargement’ pəŋairan ‘irrigation’\n\nIn what follows here derivations like bəsarkan and airi will be considered as VTRs, and pəmbəsaran and pəŋairan as nouns derived from these VTRs (the fact that they ultimately derive from the VSI bəsar and the noun air is not relevant for the paN- -an derivation). There are many shortcomings in the following presentation of the morphology of the six isolects. These are mainly due to the lack of information for some isolects, to the variety of methods used for describing data in the individual isolects, and to the inadequacy of some of these descriptions.

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

Further investigation is required to test this. However, a similar opposition also exists between the Standard Indonesian causative prefix per- and the applicative -kan. Alwi et al (1998) argue that the perverbs express an increase in the quality named by the stative verb root whereas the -kan verbs describe a complete change of state. So in Indonesian these two affixes encode similar processes: per- focuses on the origin of the event whereas -kan shows its end point.\nIn examples (203) to (206) the function of the prefix pa- is less easy to predict. In these examples pa- has a different semantic effect when it affixes to active verb roots aja, ‘teach’, duduak, ‘sit’, tagak, ‘stand’, and cuci, ‘wash’. The effect of applicative marking on each of these verbs is also different and this also has an effect on how pa- interacts with the applicatives.",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

In (97) the verb cuci appears in bare form without maN-. However, there are no major syntactic differences between this sentence and example (96) in which the verb is marked by the active voice prefix.

In (98) notice that the beneficiary bininyo, ‘his wife’, is marked as an adjunct by untuak in (98a) and (98b) regardless of the presence of the applicative. However, the adjunct marking preposition untuak can be deleted and the beneficiary can be moved to post verbal position if the applicative -an is present. In (98c) and (98d) sentences the beneficiary bininyo has been moved to post verbal position and untuak has been deleted. However, notice that (98c) is ungrammatical because there is no applicative on the verb. This suggests that in (98d) bininyo is part of the core argument structure of the verb whereas in (98c) it is not (see Chapter 5).\n\n(98) a.\n\nInyo mambuek kopi untuak\n3 AV-make coffee for\n‘He made coffee for his wife.’\n\nbininyo.\nwife-3\n\nb.

Adjuncts do not form part of the predicate’s core argument structure and are marked by a preposition. Like active intransitives, active transitive predicates can be marked by the active voice marker maN-. Example (96) illustrates a canonical active transitive clause with the active transitive predicate mancuci, ‘wash’. Notice that sabun, ‘soap’, is marked by the preposition jo because it is an adjunct.\n\n(96)\n\nInyo mancuci tangannyo jo sabun.\n\n3 AV-wash hand-3\n\nwith soap\n\n‘He washed his hands with soap.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations.

Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available.

                "content": "Chapter 6. Bare Verbs\n6.0 Introduction\nThroughout this study, reference has been made to ‘bare verbs’, i.e. verbs that are not marked by voice morphology. Some predicate constructions obligatorily require a bare verb (see Section 4.3) and bare verbs are also required in the P2 construction (see Section 5.1.4). Other bare verbs occur non-obligatorily in constructions where we would expect to find voice marked verbs. These non-obligatory bare verbs are more frequently found in informal and conversational language, which suggests that they are a feature of Colloquial Minangkabau rather than Standard Minangkabau.\nThis chapter describes the distribution of bare verbs in Minangkabau and explains their functions (see Section 6.1). In Colloquial Minangkabau, the use of bare verbs in place of voice marked verbs raises questions about the obligatoriness of voice marking. It also presents problems for our analysis of grammatical relations in Minangkabau since the semantic roles of the participants in a bare verb clause are unspecified and grammatical relations remain indeterminate. The existence of multifunctional bare verbs also raises questions about the nature of categoriality in the language. These issues are discussed in Section 6.2. To help understand the categoriality problems that multifunctional bare verbs present, the arguments for precategoriality in Austronesian languages will be discussed in Section 6.3.1. Then, to better understand the issues involved in indeterminate semantic roles and grammatical relations, Gil’s (2001; 2007) notion of Associational Semantics will be examined in Section 6.3.2.",

Thus, for Shibatani, although active voice indicates a pragmatically motivated opposition to passive voice, it also has conceptual underpinnings. The Minangkabau active voice marker maN- also occupies this intersection between semantics and pragmatics and also functions to show the development of an action. In Colloquial Minangkabau the functional load of maN- is primarily semantic since it is not used to mark a pragmatic voice distinction (see Chapter 6).\n\nThere is also evidence to support an analysis of meN- in Malay/Indonesian as a semantic/conceptual device used to mark aspectual notions. Hopper’s (1979) work argues that the foregrounding and backgrounding of events in Classical Malay discourse is achieved through voice marking, whereas other languages achieve this through various other strategies including tense-aspect marking on the verb, word order, and\n131",

However, speakers are generally able to assign semantic roles to participants in a clause with a bare verb, which suggests that the role of voice marking in Colloquial Minangkabau is not syntactic. In Standard Minangkabau, maN- has a clearly delineated semantic function (see Section 5.1.2.3) and di- has some associated semantic and aspectual properties as a result of its syntactic role in individuating the undergoer participant (see Section 5.1.3.3). So in Colloquial Minangkabau, the opposition between bare verbs, maN-, and di- must be primarily motivated by these semantic factors in a similar way to the opposition between the active and passive voice markers N- and di- in Riau Indonesian (see Section 2.4 and Section 6.3.2).

Bare verbs show that morphological underspecification is acceptable in Colloquial Minangkabau. As such, it is argued that Standard Minangkabau can be characterised as having an Indonesian-type voice system whereas Colloquial Minangkabau can be characterised as having a Sundic-type voice system. The existence of bare verbs does not entail that Minangkabau is a precategorial language and the study argues that Minangkabau has a clear lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.\nThis study is divided into seven chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the scope of the study and Chapter 2 constitutes a review of the relevant literature concerning the descriptive and theoretical issues involved in writing about Austronesian voice systems. Chapter 3 summarises the methodological concerns involved in collecting the linguistic data for this study. The major findings and the analysis and description of Minangkabau can then be found in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. Chapter 4 describes the Minangkabau parts of speech and predicate construction, and also discusses some derivational morphological processes. Chapter 5 provides an analysis of the pragmatically and conceptually motivated voice systems of Minangkabau. Chapter 6 then describes the use bare verbs and addresses some of the theoretical implications of their use in Colloquial Minangkabau. Finally, concluding remarks can be found in Chapter 7.\n2\n\n\f3",

For example, bare verbs can be found in object voice constructions in Madurese where voice marked verbs would be expected instead. Interestingly, most speakers find this kind of bare verb construction unacceptable even though they might frequently use it themselves in conversation, albeit unawares (Davies, 2005: 201). Bare verb forms are also used in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (Wouk, 1989). These forms are treated by Wouk as unaffixed active verbs that have a slightly different discourse function to voice marked active verbs. Similarly in colloquial ‘low’ varieties of Malay, bare forms of active verbs are used with more frequency than voice marked forms (Benjamin, 1993: 366-67). And in Tagalog, bare active verbs also occur moderately frequently in naturalistic data (Himmelmann, 2008). These recent studies of conversational and naturalistic data suggest that unaffixed use of verbs might not be a peculiar feature of Minangkabau, rather a systematic feature of colloquial registers of Austronesian languages more generally.\n184",

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation.

He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers.

Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function.

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation. Yet, as examples (263), (264) and (265) show, even in ambiguous cases voice marking is not required.",

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention.

Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them.

Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

Some Austronesian voice markers also have aspectual qualities which may be linked with their role in showing semantic and conceptual notions (cf. Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

Hopper found that in Classical Malay, clauses containing di- marked verbs were perfective, realis, active and used to encode foregrounded events, which are central to the progression of the narrative. Clauses containing meN- verbs on the other hand were imperfective, often irrealis and frequently found in backgrounded clauses.\nSimilarly, a recent study of contemporary Malay meN-, also found that the prefix was associated with imperfective and progressive aspect (Soh and Nomoto, 2008). Furthermore, in her study of Chindo, a variety of Non-Standard Indonesian spoken by the Peranakan Chinese community in Malang, East Java, Rafferty (1982) argues that the homorganic nasal prefix N-, traditionally thought of as encoding active voice, functions primarily as a marker of imperfective aspect. The passive voice marker di- conversely has the function of marking perfective aspect in this variety (see Section 2.2).\nNone of these studies claims that meN- or N- encodes imperfective aspect but it is clear that the use of the active voice prefix correlates closely with clauses that display these imperfective aspectual qualities. The fact that Minangkabau maN- has similar aspectual qualities is a result of its role in showing the development of action.\n5.1.3 Passive Voice\nTo complete our understanding of Minangkabau’s pragmatically motivated voice system now let us discuss the phonological, syntactic and semantic effects of the passive voice marker di-.\n5.1.3.1 Phonological Properties of di-\nIn Minangkabau, passive voice is encoded by the morpheme di-.

However, di- does not behave like a prefix in Minangkabau. Williams (1961: 66-67) labels the Minangkabau passive voice marker di- a “quasi prefix” but I argue that it is a proclitic. Evidence\n132",

Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT. Solution (4) yields more perspectives, because it fits in with the fact that JKT -an(l) also seems to be borrowed. Furthermore, JKT has only two suffixes",

It sometimes alternates with 7 as in puhun,pu?un ‘tree’.\n72Grijns says that most bases with an initial cluster have a variant form with an epenthetic schwa between the consonants. Whether a group of consonants is realised as a cluster or acquires an epenthetic schwa depends among other things on the number of syllables in the lexeme. Disyllabism is favouredin the canonical shape of JKT lexemes, and the insertion of ə would often result in more than two syllables. Nevertheless, there are inherited JKT lexemes which always occur with an initial consonant cluster, and which can form a contrasting minimal pair with lexemes containing a schwa. They may have a sound-symbolic value, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a stop or s + a liquid. Sometimes they are the result either of extension of a monosyllabic lexeme, or of reduction ofanother (non-monosyllabic) lexeme, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a nasal + a homorganic stop. (Grijns 1981:19-28). In the word-structural interpretation underlying Abdul Chaer's dictionary, initial clusters of s + a liquid do not occur. 73This list of clusters is not exhaustive (Abdul Chaer 1976:passim).",

Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language.

It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”",

One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT. Solution (4) yields more perspectives, because it fits in with the fact that JKT -an(l) also seems to be borrowed. Furthermore, JKT has only two suffixes",

Non-core arguments can also be assigned core status, and thus become available to be selected as the pivot, with the use of the general applicative -an or the locative applicative -i (see Section 5.3).\n\nTo demonstrate how the core/non-core distinction has an effect on which argument can be selected as the pivot, consider the two verbs agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’. The verb agiah is ditransitive so specifies three arguments as part of its underlying argument structure: an actor, an undergoer and a recipient. However, buek is transitive so only specifies two arguments: an actor and an undergoer, but the use of the applicative -an licenses an additional benefactor participant.\n\nExamples (129) and (130) show the use of these two verbs, agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’, respectively. In (129b) the recipient argument, inyo, ‘him’, (which is marked in bold), is assigned core argument status. This means that it can appear unmarked, i.e. without the preposition ka, in post-verbal position.

However, the pervasive use of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau have meant that the properties that make the P2 construction distinct in Standard Minangkabau do not apply in Colloquial Minangkabau. In fact, the evidence suggests that the P2 construction has merged with the bare active construction in the Colloquial variety.\n\nAs described in Section 5.1.4, the P2 construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau has a restrictive set of word order constraints. In Standard Minangkabau, nothing must intervene between the actor and the verb in a P2 clause, therefore all auxiliaries (i.e. negators and TAM adverbials) must precede the actor, whereas in a Standard Minangkabau active sentence, auxiliaries can intervene between the actor and the verb. In fact, if these clausal components occurred before the actor NP, then the sentence’s acceptability would be very much reduced. We do not find these word order constraints in Colloquial Minangkabau and in fact find that clauses with bare verbs allow both ‘auxiliary + actor’ and ‘actor + auxiliary’ word orders.\n\nFor example, consider the sentences in (266) which show that there are no constraints on the ordering of the actor NP and the auxiliary components in an active clause.\n\n(266) a. b. c.\n\nInyo acok ubah gayanyo.\n3 often change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo ubah gayanyo.\noften 3 change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo maubah gayanyo.\noften 3 AV-change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\n(Elicitation)\n\n199",

For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

In the Malay/Indonesian P2 construction, the verb is not marked for voice and the actor-verb word order of an active sentence is retained. However, the undergoer occurs in pre-verbal position and is assigned pivot status (Chung, 1976a). In the Malay/Indonesian di- passive construction, the actor is clearly demoted to non-core argument status, whereas the actor in a P2 clause remains a core argument of the verb (Arka and Manning, 2008; Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006). A further distinguishing feature of the P2 construction is that no auxiliaries (i.e. negators and TAM adverbials) may intervene between the actor and the verb (Sneddon, 1996: 249) (see Section 2.2).\n145",

Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Both transitive and intransitive bare active verbs were found in the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus, but intransitive verbs were found to be unmarked more frequently than transitives.

However, the pervasive use of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau have meant that the properties that make the P2 construction distinct in Standard Minangkabau do not apply in Colloquial Minangkabau. In fact, the evidence suggests that the P2 construction has merged with the bare active construction in the Colloquial variety.\n\nAs described in Section 5.1.4, the P2 construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau has a restrictive set of word order constraints. In Standard Minangkabau, nothing must intervene between the actor and the verb in a P2 clause, therefore all auxiliaries (i.e. negators and TAM adverbials) must precede the actor, whereas in a Standard Minangkabau active sentence, auxiliaries can intervene between the actor and the verb. In fact, if these clausal components occurred before the actor NP, then the sentence’s acceptability would be very much reduced. We do not find these word order constraints in Colloquial Minangkabau and in fact find that clauses with bare verbs allow both ‘auxiliary + actor’ and ‘actor + auxiliary’ word orders.\n\nFor example, consider the sentences in (266) which show that there are no constraints on the ordering of the actor NP and the auxiliary components in an active clause.\n\n(266) a. b. c.\n\nInyo acok ubah gayanyo.\n3 often change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo ubah gayanyo.\noften 3 change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo maubah gayanyo.\noften 3 AV-change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\n(Elicitation)\n\n199",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”",

Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988).

This is because a sophisticated electronic database like the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus allows for usually time consuming and tedious tasks such as searching and counting to be performed quickly and easily. This means that the researcher can speedily search for specific constructions and morphemes in order to do comparisons, to check their frequency and to perform empirical analyses.\nAnother benefit of this corpus is that it allows for the posterity of the primary linguistic data. This means that the primary data can be made available for future language maintenance efforts in the community. Since future developments in linguistic theory can have a significant impact on grammatical analysis it is also important to have the primary data available so that further analysis of the language can be undertaken (Himmelmann, 2006b: 18-19).\n3.2 Fieldwork\nAlthough corpus based analyses of language have a number of benefits, fieldwork is also an important aspect of linguistic research. So as well as using the texts and naturalistic data found in the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus I also conducted fieldwork in order to help answer some of the questions that the data in the corpus raised.

Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

In Standard Minangkabau, maN- has a clearly delineated semantic function (see Section 5.1.2.3) and di- has some associated semantic and aspectual properties as a result of its syntactic role in individuating the undergoer participant (see Section 5.1.3.3). So in Colloquial Minangkabau, the opposition between bare verbs, maN-, and di- must be primarily motivated by these semantic factors in a similar way to the opposition between the active and passive voice markers N- and di- in Riau Indonesian (see Section 2.4 and Section 6.3.2).

In Minangkabau it is usually the pre-verbal participant that is the pivot, but if the verb is not marked for voice then it is unclear whether the pre-verbal participant is an actor or an undergoer. However, as the examples in Section 6.1.2 showed, speakers are usually able to disambiguate the semantic roles of the participants and work out what the intended ‘voice’ of the verb is.\nAs discussed in Section 6.1.2, discourse context and real world knowledge provide the clues that allow hearers to disambiguate the semantic roles of the bare verb’s arguments. If one of the arguments in the clause refers to a participant in the conversation, is the protagonist of the narrative, has had more previous mentions than another participant, or if one of the participants is definite and the other is not, then that participant will be highly referential and topical and will therefore serve as the pivot. Establishing which is an actor and which is an undergoer is more difficult.

Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988).

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

This is because a sophisticated electronic database like the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus allows for usually time consuming and tedious tasks such as searching and counting to be performed quickly and easily. This means that the researcher can speedily search for specific constructions and morphemes in order to do comparisons, to check their frequency and to perform empirical analyses.\nAnother benefit of this corpus is that it allows for the posterity of the primary linguistic data. This means that the primary data can be made available for future language maintenance efforts in the community. Since future developments in linguistic theory can have a significant impact on grammatical analysis it is also important to have the primary data available so that further analysis of the language can be undertaken (Himmelmann, 2006b: 18-19).\n3.2 Fieldwork\nAlthough corpus based analyses of language have a number of benefits, fieldwork is also an important aspect of linguistic research.

In Minangkabau it is usually the pre-verbal participant that is the pivot, but if the verb is not marked for voice then it is unclear whether the pre-verbal participant is an actor or an undergoer. However, as the examples in Section 6.1.2 showed, speakers are usually able to disambiguate the semantic roles of the participants and work out what the intended ‘voice’ of the verb is.\nAs discussed in Section 6.1.2, discourse context and real world knowledge provide the clues that allow hearers to disambiguate the semantic roles of the bare verb’s arguments. If one of the arguments in the clause refers to a participant in the conversation, is the protagonist of the narrative, has had more previous mentions than another participant, or if one of the participants is definite and the other is not, then that participant will be highly referential and topical and will therefore serve as the pivot. Establishing which is an actor and which is an undergoer is more difficult. Some contextual background can also help, and so can some knowledge of the world, for example bananas are more likely to be chopped than be the ones chopping (see example (261)).",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”",

Notice that the verb is marked by both the proclitic ji, which is co-referential with the (null) agent, and the enclitic geuh, which is coreferential with the undergoer, gopnyan, ‘he’. In Acehnese transitive verbs, the agents are compulsorily referenced by proclitics whereas undergoers are only optionally referenced by enclitics. The presence of undergoer enclitics implies that the undergoer is topical therefore it is rare to have a undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is topical (Durie, 1985a: 201-06). In example (15) the undergoer is indeed topical since the agent is not overtly expressed. Notice also that the undergoer appears before the verb. The ability to appear in pre-verbal position is a property of Core Topics in Acehnese (see below).\n\nSince both active and stative verbs can be either agent oriented or undergoer oriented, Durie (1985a) argues that the split between agent oriented verbs and undergoer oriented verbs is instead defined according to the semantic notions of control and de-control. If a verb takes an agent, the ultimate initiator of the event, it is a controlled verb, whereas if a verb takes an undergoer, the participant that is ultimately affected by the event, then it is a de-controlled verb (Durie, 1985a: 55-56). Table 4 shows some examples of agent oriented (i.e. controlled) verbs and undergoer oriented (i.e. de-controlled) verbs. Notice that both the controlled and de-controlled categories include verbs which are semantically active and verbs which are semantically stative.\n\n32\n\n\fTable 4.

In (262) Puskesmas, ‘the Community Health Centre’, must also be the undergoer for similar reasons.

The applicative -an licenses benefactors for transitive verbs whose semantics prevent a dative-like ‘giving’ reading. For example, in (236) the applicative -an combines with the transitive verb root masak, ‘cook’, to create the benefactive verb mamasakan, ‘cook for someone’. The applicative licenses a benefactive participant and not a recipient participant due to the semantics of the verb root masak.

Some applicatives also allow comitative and ‘reason’ participants to be raised to core argument status (Sirk, 1996).

                "content": "5.3.1 Multifunctional -an\nThe Minangkabau applicative -an acts as a valency increaser, deriving transitive verbs from intransitive roots and deriving ditransitive verbs from transitive roots. In ditransitive active voice constructions it allows for recipient and benefactor participants to be promoted to core argument status. The applicative also allows for benefactive, but not recipient participants, to be realised as the undergoer pivot in passive voice constructions.\nThe -an applicative also has some secondary semantic functions. It can be seen to act as a causative marker when deriving transitive verbs from stative verb roots. It also has some aspectual properties, adding completive aspect to activity verbs. These semantic properties are a ‘side effect’ of -an’s role in showing the evolution of the action. Since -an functions to show the termination point of an event, it marks the degree of affectedness of the undergoer. This in turn produces these secondary semantic effects.\nThe semantic effects of -an will be discussed further in Section 5.3.1.3 but first let us examine the syntactic effects of this applicative.\n5.3.1.1 Syntactic Effects of -an\nExamples (231) and (232) show how -an functions as a valency increasing device when it combines with a stative verb root. In (231a), the root sakik, ‘hurt, sick’, is a stative verb. In (231b), -an modifies the argument structure of the stative verb root to create the active transitive verb manyakikan, ‘hurt’. The applicative also gives the verb a causative meaning; in terms of its event structure manyakikan means ‘cause to become hurt’. Note that -an can occur on stative roots to derive transitive verbs without the need for maNprefixation as (231c) shows. Note also that although the affixation of maN- derives an intransitive change of state verbs from stative roots (see Section 5.1.2.3), the form *manyakik does not exist.\n170\n\n\f(231) a. b. c.\n\nMeja tu\n\ntasipak dek Silvie jadi sakik kakinyo.",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan.

So in Indonesian these two affixes encode similar processes: per- focuses on the origin of the event whereas -kan shows its end point.\nIn examples (203) to (206) the function of the prefix pa- is less easy to predict. In these examples pa- has a different semantic effect when it affixes to active verb roots aja, ‘teach’, duduak, ‘sit’, tagak, ‘stand’, and cuci, ‘wash’. The effect of applicative marking on each of these verbs is also different and this also has an effect on how pa- interacts with the applicatives.",

The applicative -an licenses benefactors for transitive verbs whose semantics prevent a dative-like ‘giving’ reading.

In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity.

Non-core arguments can also be assigned core status, and thus become available to be selected as the pivot, with the use of the general applicative -an or the locative applicative -i (see Section 5.3).\n\nTo demonstrate how the core/non-core distinction has an effect on which argument can be selected as the pivot, consider the two verbs agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’. The verb agiah is ditransitive so specifies three arguments as part of its underlying argument structure: an actor, an undergoer and a recipient. However, buek is transitive so only specifies two arguments: an actor and an undergoer, but the use of the applicative -an licenses an additional benefactor participant.\n\nExamples (129) and (130) show the use of these two verbs, agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’, respectively. In (129b) the recipient argument, inyo, ‘him’, (which is marked in bold), is assigned core argument status. This means that it can appear unmarked, i.e. without the preposition ka, in post-verbal position.

Foregrounded clauses are typically realis and are associated with perfective or telic aspect.\nHopper and Thompson (1980) also argue that passive clauses are associated with telic aspect. In passive clauses, the undergoer is conceptually salient and highly referential. According to Hopper and Thompson, this suggests that the undergoer is highly individuated, which in turn also means that the clause is high in transitivity. Another feature of clauses high in transitivity is that they are associated with telic aspect due to the degree of affectedness of the undergoer. Thus di- clauses in Minangkabau can be given a telic reading not because aspectual marking is a direct property of di-, but because di- clauses are high in transitivity.\n5.1.4 The Pasif Semu\nIn Standard Minangkabau, there is another kind of passive voice construction called the pasif semu (henceforth the P2 construction). Like a di- passive, the undergoer in a P2 construction performs the pivot function. However, unlike a di- passive, the actor in a P2 construction retains its status as a core argument. The P2 verb is unmarked yet the construction remains distinctive from a bare active construction because of the word order constraints it exhibits. However, due to the high frequency of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau, the P2 is not a distinctive construction in this variety (see Section 3.3 and Section 6.1.2.4).",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

So, Wouk (1989: 233-34; 1996: 366; 2004a) argues that the relative saliency of actor and patient arguments “as mediated through theme and topic” also motivates the choice of voice morphology. As Wouk (1996: 381) defines it, a “theme” is a “referent that is the focus of attention”. It is a referent that has a high frequency of mentions throughout a text and is most often a pronoun or zero anaphora. A topic, on the other hand, is essentially “what a text or segment of text is about. [It] need not be an individual entity; it may also be a class or concept”. Topics can be identified by continuity of mention (Wouk, 1996: 382). So di- clauses are used when the patient participant is thematic and/or topical, and N- clauses are used when the actor participant is thematic and/or topical.\n\nFor example, consider the SJI dialogue presented in (8). The choice of the passive voice marker di- in A1, A2 and A4 is triggered by the thematicity and topicality of the patient participant. The thematic referent, i.e. the patient, is the person telling the story, participant A, who is recounting meeting her new boyfriend’s parents. The patient is not overtly expressed in A’s first and second utterances but it is understood to refer to the speaker and to be thematic. Notice that the verbs dianggap, ‘consider’, and dikenalkenalin, ‘introduce’, are marked for passive voice by di-. This is because even though it is not overtly expressed, the patient is the most referentially salient participant.\n\n(8) A1: Heeh, udah dianggap anak nih.\nuhuh, already DI-consider child this\n‘uhuh, they consider (me) their child.’\n\nB1: Oh ya.\n\nA2: Udah dikenal-kenalin ke keluarganya.\n\nalready DI-know-in\n\nto family-GEN\n\n‘They’ve introduced (me) to their family.’\n\nB2: Hm.\n\n27",

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant.

The relational properties of verbs in Minangkabau are inextricably linked to the language’s system of voice marking. Since voice in Minangkabau is the focus of Chapter 5, discussion of these relational properties can be found in Chapter 5 instead.\n\nFirst, let us examine the adverbial notions associated with verbs in Minangkabau. As Table 10 shows, negation, but not evidentiality, is a grammatical category in Minangkabau.\n68\n\n\fIn Indonesian, verbal and nominal predicates can be distinguished by the choice of negator.

I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

In (5b) the verb is marked for goal voice, meaning that the goal bigas, ‘rice’, is the pivot. In (5c) the direction is the pivot therefore the verb is marked for locative voice, and in (5d) the benefactor is pivot therefore the verb is marked for benefactive voice.\nAn additional typologically salient feature of Philippine-type voice systems is that they are symmetrical (Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2005; 2008). This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6). Thus, voice marking in Philippine-type languages also has a verbal derivational function.\n2.2 Indonesian-type Voice",

Some Austronesian voice markers also have aspectual qualities which may be linked with their role in showing semantic and conceptual notions (cf. Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

Thus, for Shibatani, although active voice indicates a pragmatically motivated opposition to passive voice, it also has conceptual underpinnings. The Minangkabau active voice marker maN- also occupies this intersection between semantics and pragmatics and also functions to show the development of an action. In Colloquial Minangkabau the functional load of maN- is primarily semantic since it is not used to mark a pragmatic voice distinction (see Chapter 6).\n\nThere is also evidence to support an analysis of meN- in Malay/Indonesian as a semantic/conceptual device used to mark aspectual notions. Hopper’s (1979) work argues that the foregrounding and backgrounding of events in Classical Malay discourse is achieved through voice marking, whereas other languages achieve this through various other strategies including tense-aspect marking on the verb, word order, and\n131",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

It was argued that this class of lexical/derivational devices function to show a conceptually motivated system of voice oppositions and that this voice system can be usefully described in terms of Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework. Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

Foregrounded clauses are typically realis and are associated with perfective or telic aspect.\nHopper and Thompson (1980) also argue that passive clauses are associated with telic aspect. In passive clauses, the undergoer is conceptually salient and highly referential. According to Hopper and Thompson, this suggests that the undergoer is highly individuated, which in turn also means that the clause is high in transitivity. Another feature of clauses high in transitivity is that they are associated with telic aspect due to the degree of affectedness of the undergoer. Thus di- clauses in Minangkabau can be given a telic reading not because aspectual marking is a direct property of di-, but because di- clauses are high in transitivity.\n5.1.4 The Pasif Semu\nIn Standard Minangkabau, there is another kind of passive voice construction called the pasif semu (henceforth the P2 construction). Like a di- passive, the undergoer in a P2 construction performs the pivot function. However, unlike a di- passive, the actor in a P2 construction retains its status as a core argument. The P2 verb is unmarked yet the construction remains distinctive from a bare active construction because of the word order constraints it exhibits. However, due to the high frequency of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau, the P2 is not a distinctive construction in this variety (see Section 3.3 and Section 6.1.2.4).",

Similarly in (255) and (256), the topical undergoer nyo is in pre-verbal position and the verb is followed by a full NP actor adjunct: dek baruak ko, ‘by the crowd of short-tailed macaques’ in (255), and dek pak tani, ‘by the farmer’ in (256). So even though the verb is unmarked for voice, the conditions for a passive interpretation are satisfied because there is a topical undergoer and the syntactised clause structure of a di- passive is maintained.\n\nThe facts about examples (254), (255) and (256) suggest that di- is not required to mark passive voice on the verb so long as the undergoer is topical and known to the hearer,\n191\n\n\fand the rigid structural organisation of the passive clause is adhered to. The clearest indicator of passive clause organisation is the presence of the actor marking preposition dek. This preposition simplifies the task of assigning semantic roles to the participants; dek marks the actor, therefore if there is a pre-verbal participant then it must be the undergoer. In fact, the presence of a post verbal ‘dek + actor’ phrase is incompatible with active voice syntax as examples (257) and (258) illustrate.\n\n(257) a. b. c.\n\nTapi nyo agiahe dek urang ceke.\nbut 3 give-3 CAUSE person talk-3\n‘But he was given it by someone, he said.’\n(Text ID: 474934091648030406)\nTapi nyo diagiahe dek urang ceke.\nbut 3 PV-give-3 CAUSE person talk-3\n‘But he was given it by someone, he said.’\n(Elicitation)\n*Tapi nyo maagiahe dek urang ceke.\nbut 3 AV-give-3 CAUSE person talk-3\n(Elicitation)\n\n(258) a. b. c.",

Nevertheless, the verb in (20a) is marked by the generalised active marker N- whereas the verb in (20b) is marked by the generalised patient marker di-. Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice. The sentences in (21) show two Riau Indonesian ‘neutral’ constructions in which the verb beli, ‘buy’, is unmarked.\n\n(21) a.\n\nBeli aku laser, kan.\nbuy 1sg laser Q\n‘I’ll buy a laser, right.’ [Context: Contemplating a shopping trip.]\n\n38\n\n\fb.

In (21a) notice that the verb is followed by the actor, the first person pronoun aku, and then the patient, laser, ‘ a laser’. However, in (21b) the verb is followed by the patient, nasi goreng, ‘fried rice’, and then the actor, aku.",

These cognates agree in their function of denoting unintentionality or potentiality of action, process or state when they are prefixed to a VTR or a VDI (or a precategorial). In SM, MIN, BH, and IBN, the subject of a tor-/ta-/to- form is (involuntarily) agent or object of the performance. In SWY, the subject of a form with to- is always the object (in the examples in Helfrich and in Aliana et al.). In JKT (and in Indonesian SM) the subject of a to-(/ter-) form is always object if the base is a VTR. JKT toforms are not productive.\nI presume that the PM ancestral form of tor- etc. was a prefix denoting unintentionality and potentiality of a performance, and that the active or passive meaning of this ancestral form depended on the context.118887 That the semantics of tor- etc. should not be associated with passivity is even more clear from its application in Classical and Malaysian SM, where sentences like saya tormakan lalat ‘I swallowed a fly (by accident)’ (with a subject in the agent role) are accepted. In Indonesian SM the same message would be expressed as Lalat tormakan oleh saya.\nThe prefix tor- and its cognates are also prefixed to VSIs: in SM and SWY they form superlatives, in MIN excessives, and in BH comparatives. In IBN and JKT to- does not occur with VSIs. There are two possible underlying causes of this situation: either (1) tor/ta-/to- extended its valency to VSIs in SM, MIN, BH, and SWY, or (2) constructions of IBN and JKT to- + VSIs were replaced by periphrastic constructions. If (1) applies, then tor- + VSIs is innovative. In case (2) a PM form which also occurred with VSIs must be reconstructed. Such a form may have denoted a higher degree, which later on developed into clearcut meanings such as comparative, superlative, or excessive. But it could also have",

Positing an original excessive meaning has the advantage of putting the origin of tor- etc. + VSIs more in line with for- etc. + VTRs, VDIs or precategorials (i.e. with tor- with an unintentional meaning). This means that only one PM prefix would need to be reconstructed for both, with an unintentional and excessive meaning combined with a potential one; this prefix would have occurred with all verbs (VSIs, VDIs, VTRs, precategorials). But with the evidence at hand it is safer to limit oneself to what can actually be reconstructed with certainty. That is a PM prefix *tAr-, which occurred at least with VTRs and VDIs (including precategorials), and which conveyed the notion of unintentionality and potentiality. The subject of a *£Ar- form was either object or (involuntary) agent of the performance.\n6.2.8 Reconstruction of *tAr-\nI reconstruct *£Ar-, which contributed the notion of unintentionality or feasibility to the VTR or VDI to which it was affixed.

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

In (203a) the verb is marked for active voice and the sentence is a simple transitive construction. In (203b) the verb is marked by the applicative -an which alters argument structure of the verb. Maajaan is a ditransitive verb and the recipient participant anakanak, ‘children’, can appear in undergoer position directly following the verb. In (203c) the verb mampalajari, ‘learn’, is marked by the causative marker pa-. Notice that this verb must also be marked by the locative applicative -i to be grammatical. The interaction of the causative prefix pa- with the locative applicative changes the semantics of the verb root entirely so that we get an almost reflexive meaning, i.e. ‘teach to oneself’.\n158",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

Precategorial bases will be indicated by a preceding hyphen, and their meanings will be given between brackets.\nOther verb classes are not distinguished. Apart from VTRs and VDIs, Muhadjir (1981:13), in his treatment of word classes in JKT, also distinguishes “semi-transitives” along with adjectives, intransitive verbs, and transitive verbs (which are comparable to VSIs, VDIs, and VTRs respectively in this study). Semi-transitives have co-constituents, but these are complements, not objects: since the semi-transitives have no object-oriented form these complements can only be made subject by the use of transitive (derived) verb forms. The co-constituents are often introduced with amd (also translatable as ‘with, towards’). Reciprocal verbs all belong to the category of semi-transitives because they usually also have co-constituents. Muhadjir's “semi-transitives” could be distinguished on the same terms for SM as for JKT: SM also has a class of verbs which can govern a complement which, however, cannot function as subject vis-a-vis these verbs (e.g. suka Tike (s.th. or s.o.)’, tahu ‘know (s.th.)’, bəlajar ‘study, learn (s.th.)’, bərbieara ‘speak (a language)’; these verbs do not require a preposition). Rather than adding another subclass of verbs to the ones already distinguished here, I prefer to consider Muhadjir's semi-transitives as a subclass of VDIs that have the faculty of taking a complement (which may or may not be introduced by a preposition), which is in correlation with their semantics.\nAs far as PM is concerned, I do not make any attempt to reconstruct the word-class system although I assume that comparable word classes must have existed.

Cross-linguistically, applicatives function as transitivisers. For intransitive verb roots applicatives license an additional argument and for transitive roots they function to increase the transitivity of the verb, or to modify the verb’s argument structure. Applicatives also allow for non-core arguments such as prepositional, indirective, benefactive and instrumental participants, to be included as part of the verb’s core argument structure (Peterson, 2007: 2). Some applicatives also allow comitative and ‘reason’ participants to be raised to core argument status (Sirk, 1996). Furthermore, applicatives may have secondary semantic functions in addition to their valency changing functions, including deriving verbs from nominal sources and marking aspectual notions such as continuous, iterative and intense activity (Klamer, 2000).",

Notice that the verb is marked by both the proclitic ji, which is co-referential with the (null) agent, and the enclitic geuh, which is coreferential with the undergoer, gopnyan, ‘he’. In Acehnese transitive verbs, the agents are compulsorily referenced by proclitics whereas undergoers are only optionally referenced by enclitics. The presence of undergoer enclitics implies that the undergoer is topical therefore it is rare to have a undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is topical (Durie, 1985a: 201-06). In example (15) the undergoer is indeed topical since the agent is not overtly expressed. Notice also that the undergoer appears before the verb. The ability to appear in pre-verbal position is a property of Core Topics in Acehnese (see below).\n\nSince both active and stative verbs can be either agent oriented or undergoer oriented, Durie (1985a) argues that the split between agent oriented verbs and undergoer oriented verbs is instead defined according to the semantic notions of control and de-control. If a verb takes an agent, the ultimate initiator of the event, it is a controlled verb, whereas if a verb takes an undergoer, the participant that is ultimately affected by the event, then it is a de-controlled verb (Durie, 1985a: 55-56). Table 4 shows some examples of agent oriented (i.e. controlled) verbs and undergoer oriented (i.e. de-controlled) verbs.

This rule ordering is implicit in the description of the Malayic affixes. For example, in SM, bəsar ‘big’ is a VSI, which becomes nominalised through circumfixation of ka-_-an\\ (kəbəsaran ‘largeness, greatness’); air ‘water’ is a noun. Basar and air become VTRs through suffixation of -kan and -i respectively, and as such they can become abstract nouns, i.e. nouns referring to the act or event as such in the same way as kirim ‘send’ (a VTR), viz. through affixation of poN-_ -an (6.7.3).

There are many shortcomings in the following presentation of the morphology of the six isolects. These are mainly due to the lack of information for some isolects, to the variety of methods used for describing data in the individual isolects, and to the inadequacy of some of these descriptions. The handicaps were felt most in the BH and SWY material, but they also play a role in the treatment of the other isolects.\n\n6.1 Earlier reconstructions\nIn Adelaar (1984) I discussed the transitivising affixes and the intransitive verbal prefixes bər-/ba-/bə- in the Malayic isolects. Ras (1970:439-443) and Collins (1986b:190-193) had already given attention to SM -kan, and Roolvink (1965) had studied the interrelationship of SM bar- and (məm)pər- in Classical Malay texts.

Examples (210) to (212) show how ba- can function to mark reflexive predicates. In this kind of construction the event described is active but it does not affect an undergoer participant. Instead, the action affects the actor as well. Some reflexive predicates can be encoded like a simple active clause with the use of a reflexive pronoun in undergoer position. For example, in (209) diri, ‘self’, is used as a reflexive pronoun much like the English reflexive pronoun ‘himself’. The pronoun occupies undergoer position in this example and the clause resembles a simple active construction. However, reflexive predicates marked by the ba- prefix do not require an undergoer argument because the actor is also understood as the ‘affectee’.\n\n(209)\n\nInyo bunuah diri.\n\n3 kill\n\nself\n\n‘He killed himself.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nIn example (210) a reflexive predicate baraja has been created from the transitive verb root aja ‘teach’ and the reflexive marker ba-.

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

For these predicates, I argue that ba- functions to mark middle voice. These middle predicates are intransitive but it is clear that the actor also undergoes some change, so in this sense they are broadly reflexive. Middle voice in Minangkabau resembles the middle voice of Greek which is used to mark transitive predicates that are somewhere between an active and a passive, or intransitive predicates that have a passive like relation to their subject (Bakker, 1994). In fact, the reflexive and reciprocal predicates can also be described as middle constructions since the action does not extend beyond the sphere of the actor. According to Croft’s (1991; 1994) event-based framework for voice phenomena, reflexives and reciprocals have the same event frame as middle verbs since they involve a situation in which the subject is both the initiator and end point of the action.\n\nCross-linguistically, the middle voice is associated with a number of situation types that involve similar aktionsart and event properties. Based on Talmy’s (1972) classification of event types, Kemmer (1994: 181-83) lists ten middle situation types that might involve middle marking in languages that have a middle voice. Kemmer’s middle situation types are listed in Table 19.\n\n164\n\n\fTable 19.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

But for some other lexemes a different explanation is required. Most loanwords found in BH as well as in IBN must be borrowed from SM, since SM is the most probable source for lexical borrowing common to BH and IBN, and as a lingua franca it has been very influential in other languages. BH forms like barunas, tirajaŋ, puracit, and IBN forms like tərajag and parancit, have (penultimate or antepenultimate) vowels which do not occur in SM. It is possible that these vowels are due to secondary developments, but as yet there is no evidence for this. For the forms containing them (and perhaps also for BH tarabag, IBN tarabay, which has a cognate in all other isolects) the hypothesis of a trisyllabic PM reconstruction with a *-rV-sequence is more appropriate.\nThe pre-C-R in SM, SWY, and JKT may then be explained by syncope of the following vowel as a result of the tendency to disyllabicity of lexemes (4.5). This tendency, together with a counteractive tendency to avoid heterorganic consonant clusters, is probably the reason for the occurrence of variants, one with a pre-C-R, and the other with ə breaking the consonant cluster (e.g. SM barnas/baranas; SWY saxkit/saxakit ‘wooden spoon’). Another reason for assuming that pre-C-R's originated through syncope of the following vowel is that (in SM, SWY, JKT) they are always preceded by a. This a may be the result of antepenultimate neutralisation in an originally trisyllabic form. As yet I do not know what the situation in PM was, and for the time being I reconstruct:\n(a) *-r(a)- if BH and IBN have a corresponding 0; (b) *-rV- if BH and/or IBN have a following vowel (other than IBN a).",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes. Table 10 lists each of these formal properties of verbs and describes how these properties are realised in Minangkabau.\n67\n\n\fTable 10.

For these predicates, I argue that ba- functions to mark middle voice. These middle predicates are intransitive but it is clear that the actor also undergoes some change, so in this sense they are broadly reflexive. Middle voice in Minangkabau resembles the middle voice of Greek which is used to mark transitive predicates that are somewhere between an active and a passive, or intransitive predicates that have a passive like relation to their subject (Bakker, 1994). In fact, the reflexive and reciprocal predicates can also be described as middle constructions since the action does not extend beyond the sphere of the actor. According to Croft’s (1991; 1994) event-based framework for voice phenomena, reflexives and reciprocals have the same event frame as middle verbs since they involve a situation in which the subject is both the initiator and end point of the action.\n\nCross-linguistically, the middle voice is associated with a number of situation types that involve similar aktionsart and event properties. Based on Talmy’s (1972) classification of event types, Kemmer (1994: 181-83) lists ten middle situation types that might involve middle marking in languages that have a middle voice. Kemmer’s middle situation types are listed in Table 19.\n\n164\n\n\fTable 19.

As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT. Solution (4) yields more perspectives, because it fits in with the fact that JKT -an(l) also seems to be borrowed. Furthermore, JKT has only two suffixes",

But for some other lexemes a different explanation is required. Most loanwords found in BH as well as in IBN must be borrowed from SM, since SM is the most probable source for lexical borrowing common to BH and IBN, and as a lingua franca it has been very influential in other languages. BH forms like barunas, tirajaŋ, puracit, and IBN forms like tərajag and parancit, have (penultimate or antepenultimate) vowels which do not occur in SM. It is possible that these vowels are due to secondary developments, but as yet there is no evidence for this. For the forms containing them (and perhaps also for BH tarabag, IBN tarabay, which has a cognate in all other isolects) the hypothesis of a trisyllabic PM reconstruction with a *-rV-sequence is more appropriate.\nThe pre-C-R in SM, SWY, and JKT may then be explained by syncope of the following vowel as a result of the tendency to disyllabicity of lexemes (4.5). This tendency, together with a counteractive tendency to avoid heterorganic consonant clusters, is probably the reason for the occurrence of variants, one with a pre-C-R, and the other with ə breaking the consonant cluster (e.g. SM barnas/baranas; SWY saxkit/saxakit ‘wooden spoon’). Another reason for assuming that pre-C-R's originated through syncope of the following vowel is that (in SM, SWY, JKT) they are always preceded by a. This a may be the result of antepenultimate neutralisation in an originally trisyllabic form. As yet I do not know what the situation in PM was, and for the time being I reconstruct:\n(a) *-r(a)- if BH and IBN have a corresponding 0; (b) *-rV- if BH and/or IBN have a following vowel (other than IBN a).",

For instance, transitive verbs are either transitive sui generis or secondarily derived from nouns or other verbs. Derived transitive verbs are subject to some of the same morphological processes as primary verbal bases (the derivative\nVDIs and VSIs by testing their valency with the verb məfijadi ‘become’ is from Hein Steinhauer.

For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

First, there are no clear nominalising processes in Philippine-type languages. All affixes that are used to derive nominal forms can also be used as voice marking affixes, therefore there are no unique nominalising affixes. In addition to this, inflected verb forms can also function as NP heads without any change to their morphological marking. Second, Foley argues that roots do not have an underlying argument structure. If this is the case then this means there is nothing at the lexical level to differentiate verbs from nouns.\n213",

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

                "content": "Chapter 5 describes the Minangkabau system of voice and verbal morphology. In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

For example, in (61) the verb mancarito-carito, ‘tell a story’, has been derived from the NP carito, ‘story,’ (see Section 6.3.1.3 for more examples of active verbs derived from nominals).\n\n(61)\n\nE ado mancarito-carito jo ambo.\n\nFILL exist AV-RED-story\n\nwith 1sg\n\n‘Somebody told me the story.’\n\n(Text ID: 157057083427161106)\n\nUnmarked nominals can be predicative even when a marked alternative exists.

Banamo nyo Ana.\nMID-name 3 Ana\n‘She is called Ana.’ (Elicitation)\n4.3.1.2 Numeral Predicates\nMinangkabau also has numeral predicates.

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

In (65a) ba- is affixed to duo to indicate that the pivot nyo is in a state of ‘twoness’. In (65a), the ba- affix forces the interpretation that the pivot nyo is a single entity consisting of two parts, these two parts performing the action together. Whereas in (65b), duo refers to two separate entities.\n\n(65) a.\n\nDatang nyo baduo.\ncome 3 MID-two\n‘They came together.’\n\n84\n\n\fb. Datang nyo duo.\ncome 3 two\n‘Two of them came.’\n(Elicitation)\nQuantifiers can also function as the head of a predicate construction and have the same attributive function. For example, in (66) the predicate is the quantifier banyak, ‘a lot’, which modifies the NP saudara ibu, ‘your brothers and sisters’, and in (67) the quantifier saketek, ‘a little bit’, functions as the head to modify the NP nasi, ‘rice’.\n\n(66)\n\nSaudara ibuk masih banyak?\n\nsibling mother still many\n\nDo you still have many brothers and sisters?\n\n(Text ID: 574966094643200306)\n\n(67)\n\nNasi\n\nsaketek.\n\ncooked.rice ONE-small\n\n‘There’s only a little bit of rice.’\n\n(Text ID: 833517024233300606)\n\n4.3.1.3 Existential Predicates\nExistential predicates are those which have the auxiliary verbs ado, ‘to be, to exist’, or punyo, ‘to have’, as their head.\nThe verb ado licenses a single nominal argument. In examples (68) and (69) ado is the head of the predicate construction and ujan, ‘rain’, and banyak samuik, ‘lot of ants’, are the respective arguments.\n\n(68)\n\nAdo ujan.\n\nexist rain\n\n‘It’s raining.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n85\n\n\f(69)\n\nAdo banyak samuik di tampek gulo.\n\nexist many ant\n\nLOC place sugar\n\n‘There are lots of ants in the sugar container.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Parts of Speech and Predicate Types\n4.0 Introduction\nThis chapter will define the parts of speech of Minangkabau and describe the Minangkabau predicate construction. It will first examine a number of theories concerned with defining parts of speech categories (See Section 4.1) and will then proceed to describe the open class (see Section 4.2.1) and closed class (see Section 4.2.2) categories of Minangkabau. The various kinds of predicate constructions in Minangkabau will then be discussed in Section 4.3. Understanding how Minangkabau parts of speech operate across different functional domains, including in the predicate construction, is necessary before examining the system of voice and verbal morphology in Chapter 5.\n4.1 Defining Parts of Speech\n4.1.1 Traditional Classification of Parts of Speech\nCurrent linguistic understanding about parts of speech has its origins in the Aristotelian philosophy of language, which defined parts of speech according to the nexus between notional principles and formal principles (Lyons, 1968). Central to the Aristotelian philosophy of language was the idea that the structure of language (i.e. the formal properties of language) reflected the structure of the world.\nAccording to Lyons (1968: 271), Aristotelian grammarians argued that “the physical world consists of things (‘substances’) which have certain properties (‘accidents’), initiate or undergo certain processes, stand in a certain relationship to one another, or have a certain extension or location in space and time”. In other words, a ‘substance’ is an individual entity in the real world that exists in abstraction from its ‘accidents’ (i.e. its properties of existence in space and time). This translates in grammatical terms to a distinction between a lexeme (which refers to some ‘substance’ in the real world) and its\n49",

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

This would indicate that predication really is an inherent, prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that reference is a non-prototypical function.\n\nExamples (52), (53) and (54) illustrate how verbs can be used referentiality with the use of the nominalising affixes -an, pa- and paN-. In (52) the noun tanaman, ‘plant’, is derived from the verb root tanam, ‘to plant’, in combination with the nominalising affix -an. The noun parampok, ‘thief’, in (53) makes use of the agentive nominaliser pa- to derive the form from the verb root rampok, ‘rob, steal’. The nominaliser -an is also used in (54) in combination with the paN- nominaliser to derive the noun panyalasaian, ‘ending’, from the verb root salasai, ‘finish’.

Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

Ambo maagiahan inyo pitih.\n1sg AV-give-APP 3 money\n‘I gave that guy money.’ (Elicitation)\nAnother feature of ditransitive verbs is that the recipient argument can be assigned core argument status and swap places with the undergoer argument. For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction.

Some predicate constructions obligatorily require a bare verb (see Section 4.3) and bare verbs are also required in the P2 construction (see Section 5.1.4). Other bare verbs occur non-obligatorily in constructions where we would expect to find voice marked verbs. These non-obligatory bare verbs are more frequently found in informal and conversational language, which suggests that they are a feature of Colloquial Minangkabau rather than Standard Minangkabau.\nThis chapter describes the distribution of bare verbs in Minangkabau and explains their functions (see Section 6.1). In Colloquial Minangkabau, the use of bare verbs in place of voice marked verbs raises questions about the obligatoriness of voice marking. It also presents problems for our analysis of grammatical relations in Minangkabau since the semantic roles of the participants in a bare verb clause are unspecified and grammatical relations remain indeterminate. The existence of multifunctional bare verbs also raises questions about the nature of categoriality in the language. These issues are discussed in Section 6.2. To help understand the categoriality problems that multifunctional bare verbs present, the arguments for precategoriality in Austronesian languages will be discussed in Section 6.3.1. Then, to better understand the issues involved in indeterminate semantic roles and grammatical relations, Gil’s (2001; 2007) notion of Associational Semantics will be examined in Section 6.3.2.",

Interestingly, most speakers find this kind of bare verb construction unacceptable even though they might frequently use it themselves in conversation, albeit unawares (Davies, 2005: 201). Bare verb forms are also used in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (Wouk, 1989). These forms are treated by Wouk as unaffixed active verbs that have a slightly different discourse function to voice marked active verbs. Similarly in colloquial ‘low’ varieties of Malay, bare forms of active verbs are used with more frequency than voice marked forms (Benjamin, 1993: 366-67). And in Tagalog, bare active verbs also occur moderately frequently in naturalistic data (Himmelmann, 2008). These recent studies of conversational and naturalistic data suggest that unaffixed use of verbs might not be a peculiar feature of Minangkabau, rather a systematic feature of colloquial registers of Austronesian languages more generally.\n184",

They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

Some Austronesian voice markers also have aspectual qualities which may be linked with their role in showing semantic and conceptual notions (cf. Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

However, maN- can also affix to noun roots and stative verb roots. In this case, maN- not only marks the fact that the pivot is aligned with the actor role, it has the additional derivational effect of altering underlying argument structure of the root (see Section 5.1.2.3).\n124",

I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

In (5b) the verb is marked for goal voice, meaning that the goal bigas, ‘rice’, is the pivot. In (5c) the direction is the pivot therefore the verb is marked for locative voice, and in (5d) the benefactor is pivot therefore the verb is marked for benefactive voice.\nAn additional typologically salient feature of Philippine-type voice systems is that they are symmetrical (Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2005; 2008). This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6). Thus, voice marking in Philippine-type languages also has a verbal derivational function.\n2.2 Indonesian-type Voice",

They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari.

This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function.

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation.

Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-.

However, notice in (197b) that the same sentence can also be rendered in passive voice. In this example rumahnyo remains the undergoer pivot but the semantics of the clause have changed. In (197b), it is understood that the action was instigated by an actor participant, even though the actor is not overtly expressed. In (197a) no external actor is implied and we do not know how the fire started. All the verb tabaka tells us is that the fire started involuntarily, either somebody set the house alight by accident or the house spontaneously combusted.

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

For example, in SM, bəsar ‘big’ is a VSI, which becomes nominalised through circumfixation of ka-_-an\\ (kəbəsaran ‘largeness, greatness’); air ‘water’ is a noun. Basar and air become VTRs through suffixation of -kan and -i respectively, and as such they can become abstract nouns, i.e. nouns referring to the act or event as such in the same way as kirim ‘send’ (a VTR), viz. through affixation of poN-_ -an (6.7.3).

He states that there are a number of differences in how voice affixation patterns with nominal and verbal roots in Tagalog. Most importantly, voice affixation is obligatory and productive with verbal roots, but it is optional and unsystematic with nominal roots and creates forms with highly unpredictable semantics. Moreover, for verbal roots, voice affixation functions to select different arguments as the pivot but does not change the lexical meaning of the root. However, for nominal roots, different voice affixes on the same root create forms that range greatly in meaning.\n\nPrecategorial languages must be both bidirectional and compositional, i.e. any substantive root must be able to function in any available syntactic slot and any morphological devices must have the same effects on all roots (cf. Evans and Osada, 2005). Therefore, Kroeger’s (1998) evidence that the effects of voice affixation on nominal roots are unpredictable provides the most convincing argument to support the idea that there is indeed a lexical distinction between nominal and verbal roots in Philippine-type languages.",

Apart from VTRs and VDIs, Muhadjir (1981:13), in his treatment of word classes in JKT, also distinguishes “semi-transitives” along with adjectives, intransitive verbs, and transitive verbs (which are comparable to VSIs, VDIs, and VTRs respectively in this study). Semi-transitives have co-constituents, but these are complements, not objects: since the semi-transitives have no object-oriented form these complements can only be made subject by the use of transitive (derived) verb forms. The co-constituents are often introduced with amd (also translatable as ‘with, towards’). Reciprocal verbs all belong to the category of semi-transitives because they usually also have co-constituents. Muhadjir's “semi-transitives” could be distinguished on the same terms for SM as for JKT: SM also has a class of verbs which can govern a complement which, however, cannot function as subject vis-a-vis these verbs (e.g. suka Tike (s.th. or s.o.)’, tahu ‘know (s.th.)’, bəlajar ‘study, learn (s.th.)’, bərbieara ‘speak (a language)’; these verbs do not require a preposition). Rather than adding another subclass of verbs to the ones already distinguished here, I prefer to consider Muhadjir's semi-transitives as a subclass of VDIs that have the faculty of taking a complement (which may or may not be introduced by a preposition), which is in correlation with their semantics.\nAs far as PM is concerned, I do not make any attempt to reconstruct the word-class system although I assume that comparable word classes must have existed.

The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds.

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes.

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language.

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity.

Jacobson, 1979; Swadesh, 1939), Salishan languages (cf. Jelinek and Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) and Polynesian languages (cf. Broschart, 1997; Mosel and Hovdhaugen, 1992) are said to lack a noun-verb distinction; therefore it cannot be said that the primitive features [±noun] and [±verb] are underlying in these languages. Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

This raised questions not only about the obligatoriness of voice marking but also how speakers are able to determine the semantic roles of the participants in the clause. Conducting elicitation was an essential stage in the process of understanding these bare verb forms because I was able to ask speakers about the restrictions on using these bare forms and also to test the productivity and use of these forms in syntactic and pragmatic contexts not found in the corpus.\n5 An Aqiqa is a Muslim ceremony in which a new born baby is named. 45",

When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs.

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

The verb gigik, ‘bite’, in (154) is transitive and therefore specifies an undergoer argument but in this example the undergoer argument is omitted and the verb is not marked for active voice. This means that “the semantic transitivity of the verb root is not represented” thus causing the clause to be ungrammatical (Fortin, 2001: 14). Although Fortin’s claims may represent the judgments of many Minangkabau speakers, the conversational data in the MPI EVA Minangkabau database reveals a different picture.

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Ambo maagiahan inyo pitih.\n1sg AV-give-APP 3 money\n‘I gave that guy money.’ (Elicitation)\nAnother feature of ditransitive verbs is that the recipient argument can be assigned core argument status and swap places with the undergoer argument. For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant.

Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language.

Because nouns and verbs can function in nonprototypical ways without any changes to their surface forms, these roots are not inherently nominal or verbal, some roots are just more likely to occur in nominal or verbal position due to their semantics. If we take this hypothesis to its extreme, a possible conclusion is that Minangkabau roots are precategorial; that is, categories can be defined on the basis of the construction type and lexemes do not have any ‘underlying’ category membership; they acquire nominal or verbal status only when they are used in a nominal or verbal construction.\nSimilar questions have been raised about the categorical status of roots and the role of voice morphology in other Austronesian languages, particularly Philippine-type\n212",

In addition to this, inflected verb forms can also function as NP heads without any change to their morphological marking.

He states that there are a number of differences in how voice affixation patterns with nominal and verbal roots in Tagalog. Most importantly, voice affixation is obligatory and productive with verbal roots, but it is optional and unsystematic with nominal roots and creates forms with highly unpredictable semantics. Moreover, for verbal roots, voice affixation functions to select different arguments as the pivot but does not change the lexical meaning of the root. However, for nominal roots, different voice affixes on the same root create forms that range greatly in meaning.\n\nPrecategorial languages must be both bidirectional and compositional, i.e. any substantive root must be able to function in any available syntactic slot and any morphological devices must have the same effects on all roots (cf. Evans and Osada, 2005). Therefore, Kroeger’s (1998) evidence that the effects of voice affixation on nominal roots are unpredictable provides the most convincing argument to support the idea that there is indeed a lexical distinction between nominal and verbal roots in Philippine-type languages.",

Kroeger (1998) argues that the resultant nominalisations are lexically distinct from the past tense forms of the verbs and also have unpredictable semantics. Some examples of nominalisations based on verbal roots in Kimaragang can be found in (284). Note that the -in- infix results in a semantic narrowing of the root in the nominalised forms.\n215",

For example, he suggests that a root like bigay, ‘give’, will specify the conceptual paradigm ‘giving by X of Y to Z’, but will not specify how X, Y and Z’s semantic roles map onto argument structure. The role of voice morphology is then to specify how the semantic roles specified by the root’s conceptual structure ought to be realised syntactically. To do this, the root must first become a verb. So, according to Foley, voice morphology actually performs a single derivational process: deriving a verb from a precategorial root and selecting a specific semantic role as the pivot.\nSince argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, according to Foley (1998; 2008) this means that there is no preference as to which of the participants entailed by the root’s conceptual structure gets realised as the pivot. This, he argues, shows that no one voice type is basic and that voice in Philippine-type languages is ‘symmetrical’ (see Section 2.1). Naturally, precategoriality and symmetrical voice systems are complementary features and it is these features, he argues, that are typologically salient in Philippine-type languages.\nNevertheless, whether Philippine-type languages are precategorial or not is still a matter of debate and a number of alternate analyses have been put forward. Two of these alternate analyses are discussed here. First, we will examine Kroeger’s (1998) argument against precategoriality, and second, we will discuss Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) proposal that the morphology of Philippine-type languages is multifunctional.",

This means that each voice affix has a bundle of syntactic and semantic features, only some of which are profiled in a given instance. However, the correlations between the specific syntactic and semantic sense of the affix being used and the ontological type of the root undergoing derivation is difficult to clarify. For example, in Tagalog the prefix ma- can occur with a large majority of all content words and can mean either ‘to have ROOT’ or ‘to become ROOT’ yet there is no clear and consistent patterning of nominal or verbal roots with either of these meanings (Himmelmann, 2008: 16-17).\nNeither Foley’s (1998; 2008), nor Kroeger’s (1998), nor Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) proposals can directly explain the categoriality status of the Minangkabau bare verb forms since their analyses are made to account for the peculiarities of Philippine-type languages. Nevertheless, these analyses point to three main factors for consideration before making assessments about the categorical status of roots in Minangkabau: whether the argument structure of verbs is specified in the lexicon, whether there are unique nominalisation or verbalisation processes in the language, and whether the multifunctionality of morphology patterns with specific lexical categories.

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity. Clauses with N- marked verbs were irrealis, stative, off the timeline of the main narrative events, and more likely to have non-referential patients. Clauses with di- marked verbs, on the other hand, were\n26\n\n\findicative, eventive, and on the timeline of the main narrative events. These clauses were also more likely to have referential patients that were individuated, animate, and that had continuous mention throughout the text (Wouk, 1989: 132-40).",

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

In Minangkabau it is usually the pre-verbal participant that is the pivot, but if the verb is not marked for voice then it is unclear whether the pre-verbal participant is an actor or an undergoer. However, as the examples in Section 6.1.2 showed, speakers are usually able to disambiguate the semantic roles of the participants and work out what the intended ‘voice’ of the verb is.\nAs discussed in Section 6.1.2, discourse context and real world knowledge provide the clues that allow hearers to disambiguate the semantic roles of the bare verb’s arguments. If one of the arguments in the clause refers to a participant in the conversation, is the protagonist of the narrative, has had more previous mentions than another participant, or if one of the participants is definite and the other is not, then that participant will be highly referential and topical and will therefore serve as the pivot. Establishing which is an actor and which is an undergoer is more difficult. Some contextual background can also help, and so can some knowledge of the world, for example bananas are more likely to be chopped than be the ones chopping (see example (261)).",

The verb gigik, ‘bite’, in (154) is transitive and therefore specifies an undergoer argument but in this example the undergoer argument is omitted and the verb is not marked for active voice. This means that “the semantic transitivity of the verb root is not represented” thus causing the clause to be ungrammatical (Fortin, 2001: 14). Although Fortin’s claims may represent the judgments of many Minangkabau speakers, the conversational data in the MPI EVA Minangkabau database reveals a different picture. Bare verbs are a systematic feature of Colloquial Minangkabau and sentences like (154) abound. For this reason I do not consider (154) an ungrammatical sentence.\n\n(154)\n\nInyo gigik Ø.\n3 bite Ø\n‘He bites (something).’\n(adapted from Fortin, 2001: 14)\n\nIn Colloquial Minangkabau bare forms of transitive verb roots regularly appear in clauses in which some of their arguments are omitted (see Chapter 6).

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

Precategorial bases will be indicated by a preceding hyphen, and their meanings will be given between brackets.\nOther verb classes are not distinguished. Apart from VTRs and VDIs, Muhadjir (1981:13), in his treatment of word classes in JKT, also distinguishes “semi-transitives” along with adjectives, intransitive verbs, and transitive verbs (which are comparable to VSIs, VDIs, and VTRs respectively in this study). Semi-transitives have co-constituents, but these are complements, not objects: since the semi-transitives have no object-oriented form these complements can only be made subject by the use of transitive (derived) verb forms. The co-constituents are often introduced with amd (also translatable as ‘with, towards’). Reciprocal verbs all belong to the category of semi-transitives because they usually also have co-constituents. Muhadjir's “semi-transitives” could be distinguished on the same terms for SM as for JKT: SM also has a class of verbs which can govern a complement which, however, cannot function as subject vis-a-vis these verbs (e.g. suka Tike (s.th. or s.o.)’, tahu ‘know (s.th.)’, bəlajar ‘study, learn (s.th.)’, bərbieara ‘speak (a language)’; these verbs do not require a preposition). Rather than adding another subclass of verbs to the ones already distinguished here, I prefer to consider Muhadjir's semi-transitives as a subclass of VDIs that have the faculty of taking a complement (which may or may not be introduced by a preposition), which is in correlation with their semantics.\nAs far as PM is concerned, I do not make any attempt to reconstruct the word-class system although I assume that comparable word classes must have existed.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity. Clauses with N- marked verbs were irrealis, stative, off the timeline of the main narrative events, and more likely to have non-referential patients.

These clauses were also more likely to have referential patients that were individuated, animate, and that had continuous mention throughout the text (Wouk, 1989: 132-40).",

Nevertheless, the verb in (20a) is marked by the generalised active marker N- whereas the verb in (20b) is marked by the generalised patient marker di-. Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice.

In (21a) notice that the verb is followed by the actor, the first person pronoun aku, and then the patient, laser, ‘ a laser’.

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

If we raise the undergoer participant baju ini, ‘this shirt’, to pivot position in the matrix clause, then the sentence is grammatical, as shown in (181c). However, if we raise the first person pronoun actor saya, then an ungrammatical sentence is produced in (181d).

Precategorial bases will be indicated by a preceding hyphen, and their meanings will be given between brackets.\nOther verb classes are not distinguished. Apart from VTRs and VDIs, Muhadjir (1981:13), in his treatment of word classes in JKT, also distinguishes “semi-transitives” along with adjectives, intransitive verbs, and transitive verbs (which are comparable to VSIs, VDIs, and VTRs respectively in this study). Semi-transitives have co-constituents, but these are complements, not objects: since the semi-transitives have no object-oriented form these complements can only be made subject by the use of transitive (derived) verb forms. The co-constituents are often introduced with amd (also translatable as ‘with, towards’). Reciprocal verbs all belong to the category of semi-transitives because they usually also have co-constituents. Muhadjir's “semi-transitives” could be distinguished on the same terms for SM as for JKT: SM also has a class of verbs which can govern a complement which, however, cannot function as subject vis-a-vis these verbs (e.g. suka Tike (s.th. or s.o.)’, tahu ‘know (s.th.)’, bəlajar ‘study, learn (s.th.)’, bərbieara ‘speak (a language)’; these verbs do not require a preposition). Rather than adding another subclass of verbs to the ones already distinguished here, I prefer to consider Muhadjir's semi-transitives as a subclass of VDIs that have the faculty of taking a complement (which may or may not be introduced by a preposition), which is in correlation with their semantics.\nAs far as PM is concerned, I do not make any attempt to reconstruct the word-class system although I assume that comparable word classes must have existed. The precategorials in particular have an uncertain status in PM.",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

In (145a) note that the locative non-core argument kabun, ‘garden’, is marked by the locative preposition di. The addition of an applicative on the verb allows the non-core argument core status. This results in a change in word order as the new core argument is moved to post verbal position.

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity. Clauses with N- marked verbs were irrealis, stative, off the timeline of the main narrative events, and more likely to have non-referential patients. Clauses with di- marked verbs, on the other hand, were\n26\n\n\findicative, eventive, and on the timeline of the main narrative events. These clauses were also more likely to have referential patients that were individuated, animate, and that had continuous mention throughout the text (Wouk, 1989: 132-40).",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

The verb gigik, ‘bite’, in (154) is transitive and therefore specifies an undergoer argument but in this example the undergoer argument is omitted and the verb is not marked for active voice. This means that “the semantic transitivity of the verb root is not represented” thus causing the clause to be ungrammatical (Fortin, 2001: 14). Although Fortin’s claims may represent the judgments of many Minangkabau speakers, the conversational data in the MPI EVA Minangkabau database reveals a different picture.

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way.

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes.

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

A non-core argument, on the other hand, is “peripheral” in the sense that it is not as syntactically ‘available’ as a core argument. Non-core arguments are typically adjunct-like and their non-core status is often marked by the presence of adpositions (Arka, 2003b).\n\nSo, in contrast to the symmetric passive construction, in Standard Indonesian’s asymmetric passive, the actor argument is syntactically demoted and given non-core status (Arka, 2003b; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). This is marked by the presence of the agentive/causal preposition oleh. An example of this can be seen in (6c) where the actor Sul has been given non-core status and is thus preceded by the preposition oleh.\n\nHowever, in the pasif semu, also referred to as the ‘pseudo passive’, the object voice, or passive type two (hereafter the P2 construction), both actor and undergoer are retained as core arguments (Arka and Manning, 2008; Musgrave, 2000). In the P2 construction, the undergoer is selected as the pivot (cf. Chung, 1976a) and precedes the verb. The P2 verb is not marked for voice but hosts a pronominal proclitic coding the actor. The sentence in (7) shows an example of a P2 construction. In this example notice that the undergoer buku ini, ‘this book’, is the pivot and thus precedes the verb, baca, ‘read’. The first person actor, ku, then appears as a proclitic on the verb.\n\n(7)\n\nBuku ini\n\nsudah ku=baca.\n\nbook DEM:prox PFCT 1sg=read\n\n‘I have read this book.’\n\n(adapted from Sneddon, 1996: 249)",

He argues that a Core Role is a participant licensed by the\n34\n\n\fverb’s argument structure that is syntactically ‘available’. Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988).

In Minangkabau, only core arguments can be selected as pivots. The distinction between core and non-core arguments reflects a difference in syntactic status, but it also reflects a difference in their “degree of discourse relevance” (Shibatani, 2006: 261). Core arguments are unmarked and are licensed by the verb’s argument structure. They are also assigned more discourse relevance than non-core arguments. Non-core arguments on the other hand, are not part of the verb’s argument structure and are often accordingly case marked (Foley and Van Valin, 1984: 79). In Minangkabau, non-core arguments are marked by prepositions (see Section 4.2.2.2).\nIn Minangkabau, the argument structure of intransitive verb roots licenses a single core argument: stative verbs license an undergoer whereas active intransitives license an actor. Transitive verb roots license two core arguments: an actor and an undergoer,\n113",

                "content": "Foley (1998: 30) proposes that if roots do not entail argument structure, then they specify “some generalized conceptual structure” in the lexicon instead. For example, he suggests that a root like bigay, ‘give’, will specify the conceptual paradigm ‘giving by X of Y to Z’, but will not specify how X, Y and Z’s semantic roles map onto argument structure. The role of voice morphology is then to specify how the semantic roles specified by the root’s conceptual structure ought to be realised syntactically. To do this, the root must first become a verb. So, according to Foley, voice morphology actually performs a single derivational process: deriving a verb from a precategorial root and selecting a specific semantic role as the pivot.\nSince argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, according to Foley (1998; 2008) this means that there is no preference as to which of the participants entailed by the root’s conceptual structure gets realised as the pivot. This, he argues, shows that no one voice type is basic and that voice in Philippine-type languages is ‘symmetrical’ (see Section 2.1). Naturally, precategoriality and symmetrical voice systems are complementary features and it is these features, he argues, that are typologically salient in Philippine-type languages.\nNevertheless, whether Philippine-type languages are precategorial or not is still a matter of debate and a number of alternate analyses have been put forward. Two of these alternate analyses are discussed here. First, we will examine Kroeger’s (1998) argument against precategoriality, and second, we will discuss Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) proposal that the morphology of Philippine-type languages is multifunctional.",

Non-core arguments can also be assigned core status, and thus become available to be selected as the pivot, with the use of the general applicative -an or the locative applicative -i (see Section 5.3).\n\nTo demonstrate how the core/non-core distinction has an effect on which argument can be selected as the pivot, consider the two verbs agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’. The verb agiah is ditransitive so specifies three arguments as part of its underlying argument structure: an actor, an undergoer and a recipient. However, buek is transitive so only specifies two arguments: an actor and an undergoer, but the use of the applicative -an licenses an additional benefactor participant.\n\nExamples (129) and (130) show the use of these two verbs, agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’, respectively. In (129b) the recipient argument, inyo, ‘him’, (which is marked in bold), is assigned core argument status. This means that it can appear unmarked, i.e. without the preposition ka, in post-verbal position. This also means that if agiah, ‘give’, is marked for passive voice, both the undergoer pitih, ‘money’, and the recipient inyo, ‘him’, are available to be selected as the pivot (see (129c) and (129d)).\n\n(129) a.\n\nAli maagiah pitih ka\nAli AV-give money to\n‘Ali gave money to him.’\n\ninyo.\n3\n\nb.

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

                "content": "Example (187a) is a canonical bare active construction in which the actor pivot aden precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo follows the verb. Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”",

These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes. Table 10 lists each of these formal properties of verbs and describes how these properties are realised in Minangkabau.\n67\n\n\fTable 10.

It could also be the case that cuci and masak in (263) and (264) are intentionally left bare so that the participants muko, ‘face’, and nyo, ‘it’, are potentially both actors and undergoers thus coercing a reflexive or middle interpretation of the event.\nFinally, since the verb caliak, ‘see’, in (265a) is not marked for voice, determining the semantic roles of the participants referred to by the pronouns den and -e is a difficult task if the sentence is taken out of context.\nBoth active and passive permutations of the sentence are possible as (265b) and (265c) demonstrate; in (265b) den is the actor and -e the undergoer, whereas in (265c) den is the undergoer and -e is the actor. However, my language consultants agreed that although the passive interpretation of the sentence presented in (265c) is plausible, the interpretation presented in (265b) is preferred.

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-.

Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

However, my consultants agreed that nyo could also refer to the actor. In this case, the sentence could also be rendered in passive voice, as (264c) shows. It could also be the case that cuci and masak in (263) and (264) are intentionally left bare so that the participants muko, ‘face’, and nyo, ‘it’, are potentially both actors and undergoers thus coercing a reflexive or middle interpretation of the event.\nFinally, since the verb caliak, ‘see’, in (265a) is not marked for voice, determining the semantic roles of the participants referred to by the pronouns den and -e is a difficult task if the sentence is taken out of context.\nBoth active and passive permutations of the sentence are possible as (265b) and (265c) demonstrate; in (265b) den is the actor and -e the undergoer, whereas in (265c) den is the undergoer and -e is the actor. However, my language consultants agreed that although the passive interpretation of the sentence presented in (265c) is plausible, the interpretation presented in (265b) is preferred. This is because the way the progression of events is encoded in (265c), i.e. the speaker laughing then being looked at by someone, is unusual. It is much more likely that if the event aden galak, ‘I laughed’, is a reason or cause for the speaker to be looked at, following principles of iconicity, it ought to come after the main verb caliak, ‘see’. So for a passive interpretation to be as available as an active one, the sentence ought to read den dicaliake ma (dek) aden galak, ‘he looked at me (because) I laughed’, instead.",

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity. Clauses with N- marked verbs were irrealis, stative, off the timeline of the main narrative events, and more likely to have non-referential patients. Clauses with di- marked verbs, on the other hand, were\n26\n\n\findicative, eventive, and on the timeline of the main narrative events. These clauses were also more likely to have referential patients that were individuated, animate, and that had continuous mention throughout the text (Wouk, 1989: 132-40).",

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-. Foregrounding clauses were also more likely to be perfective, and backgrounding clauses to be imperfective. He argues then that e- and Nare associated with this aspectual distinction not categorically, but by virtue of their appearance in foregrounding and backgrounding clauses respectively.\n\nExamples (11) and (12) come from a recounting of the folk tale Bang Mera so Bang Pote, ‘Onion and Garlic’, which tells of the fate of two sisters named Onion and Garlic. In (11) we see an example of active voice used in a clause containing background information.

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice. The sentences in (21) show two Riau Indonesian ‘neutral’ constructions in which the verb beli, ‘buy’, is unmarked.\n\n(21) a.\n\nBeli aku laser, kan.\nbuy 1sg laser Q\n‘I’ll buy a laser, right.’ [Context: Contemplating a shopping trip.]\n\n38\n\n\fb.

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot.

Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes.

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

It will first examine a number of theories concerned with defining parts of speech categories (See Section 4.1) and will then proceed to describe the open class (see Section 4.2.1) and closed class (see Section 4.2.2) categories of Minangkabau. The various kinds of predicate constructions in Minangkabau will then be discussed in Section 4.3. Understanding how Minangkabau parts of speech operate across different functional domains, including in the predicate construction, is necessary before examining the system of voice and verbal morphology in Chapter 5.\n4.1 Defining Parts of Speech\n4.1.1 Traditional Classification of Parts of Speech\nCurrent linguistic understanding about parts of speech has its origins in the Aristotelian philosophy of language, which defined parts of speech according to the nexus between notional principles and formal principles (Lyons, 1968). Central to the Aristotelian philosophy of language was the idea that the structure of language (i.e. the formal properties of language) reflected the structure of the world.\nAccording to Lyons (1968: 271), Aristotelian grammarians argued that “the physical world consists of things (‘substances’) which have certain properties (‘accidents’), initiate or undergo certain processes, stand in a certain relationship to one another, or have a certain extension or location in space and time”. In other words, a ‘substance’ is an individual entity in the real world that exists in abstraction from its ‘accidents’ (i.e. its properties of existence in space and time). This translates in grammatical terms to a distinction between a lexeme (which refers to some ‘substance’ in the real world) and its\n49",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

For example, Minangkabau has a class of words that are notionally like adjectives but formally like verbs. So, like Langacker, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that parts of speech can be thought of as prototypical categories and that language specific instantiations of categories may fall somewhere within the specified prototypical domain. Properties of parts of speech can then be defined in terms of the language\n55",

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation.

This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

Some more innovative Indonesian-type languages, such as non-standard varieties of Malay/Indonesian, have retained only the homorganic nasal part of the active voice prefix. A typical Indonesian-type active voice construction will not only have voice marking on the verb, but the actor will also occupy pre-verbal position and if the verb is transitive, the undergoer will follow the verb.\nIn most Indonesian-type languages passive voice is marked on the verb by an oral prefix (i.e. a prefix with an initial oral, as opposed to nasal, stop) or a pronominal cliticised form of the agent (Ross, 2002: 54-56). In some other Indonesian-type languages the passive voice verb is unmarked. In an Indonesian-type passive voice clause the undergoer typically occupies pre-verbal position because it is the pivot.

Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

Some more innovative Indonesian-type languages, such as non-standard varieties of Malay/Indonesian, have retained only the homorganic nasal part of the active voice prefix. A typical Indonesian-type active voice construction will not only have voice marking on the verb, but the actor will also occupy pre-verbal position and if the verb is transitive, the undergoer will follow the verb.\nIn most Indonesian-type languages passive voice is marked on the verb by an oral prefix (i.e. a prefix with an initial oral, as opposed to nasal, stop) or a pronominal cliticised form of the agent (Ross, 2002: 54-56). In some other Indonesian-type languages the passive voice verb is unmarked. In an Indonesian-type passive voice clause the undergoer typically occupies pre-verbal position because it is the pivot.

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

If we raise the undergoer participant baju ini, ‘this shirt’, to pivot position in the matrix clause, then the sentence is grammatical, as shown in (181c).

Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988). An example of this construction can be found in (19).\n\n(19) a.\n\nGopnyan ka geu=côm lôn.\n\nshe\n\nalready 3-kiss\n\nI\n\n‘She (already) kissed me.’\n\nb.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Notice that the verb is marked by both the proclitic ji, which is co-referential with the (null) agent, and the enclitic geuh, which is coreferential with the undergoer, gopnyan, ‘he’. In Acehnese transitive verbs, the agents are compulsorily referenced by proclitics whereas undergoers are only optionally referenced by enclitics. The presence of undergoer enclitics implies that the undergoer is topical therefore it is rare to have a undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is topical (Durie, 1985a: 201-06). In example (15) the undergoer is indeed topical since the agent is not overtly expressed. Notice also that the undergoer appears before the verb. The ability to appear in pre-verbal position is a property of Core Topics in Acehnese (see below).\n\nSince both active and stative verbs can be either agent oriented or undergoer oriented, Durie (1985a) argues that the split between agent oriented verbs and undergoer oriented verbs is instead defined according to the semantic notions of control and de-control. If a verb takes an agent, the ultimate initiator of the event, it is a controlled verb, whereas if a verb takes an undergoer, the participant that is ultimately affected by the event, then it is a de-controlled verb (Durie, 1985a: 55-56). Table 4 shows some examples of agent oriented (i.e. controlled) verbs and undergoer oriented (i.e. de-controlled) verbs. Notice that both the controlled and de-controlled categories include verbs which are semantically active and verbs which are semantically stative.\n\n32\n\n\fTable 4.

Ditransitive verb roots, on the other hand, license a third argument which can be assigned core argument status in a ‘dative’ construction. Non-core arguments can also be assigned core status, and thus become available to be selected as the pivot, with the use of the general applicative -an or the locative applicative -i (see Section 5.3).\n\nTo demonstrate how the core/non-core distinction has an effect on which argument can be selected as the pivot, consider the two verbs agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’. The verb agiah is ditransitive so specifies three arguments as part of its underlying argument structure: an actor, an undergoer and a recipient. However, buek is transitive so only specifies two arguments: an actor and an undergoer, but the use of the applicative -an licenses an additional benefactor participant.\n\nExamples (129) and (130) show the use of these two verbs, agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’, respectively. In (129b) the recipient argument, inyo, ‘him’, (which is marked in bold), is assigned core argument status. This means that it can appear unmarked, i.e. without the preposition ka, in post-verbal position. This also means that if agiah, ‘give’, is marked for passive voice, both the undergoer pitih, ‘money’, and the recipient inyo, ‘him’, are available to be selected as the pivot (see (129c) and (129d)).\n\n(129) a.\n\nAli maagiah pitih ka\nAli AV-give money to\n‘Ali gave money to him.’\n\ninyo.\n3\n\nb.

A non-core argument, on the other hand, is “peripheral” in the sense that it is not as syntactically ‘available’ as a core argument. Non-core arguments are typically adjunct-like and their non-core status is often marked by the presence of adpositions (Arka, 2003b).\n\nSo, in contrast to the symmetric passive construction, in Standard Indonesian’s asymmetric passive, the actor argument is syntactically demoted and given non-core status (Arka, 2003b; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). This is marked by the presence of the agentive/causal preposition oleh. An example of this can be seen in (6c) where the actor Sul has been given non-core status and is thus preceded by the preposition oleh.\n\nHowever, in the pasif semu, also referred to as the ‘pseudo passive’, the object voice, or passive type two (hereafter the P2 construction), both actor and undergoer are retained as core arguments (Arka and Manning, 2008; Musgrave, 2000). In the P2 construction, the undergoer is selected as the pivot (cf. Chung, 1976a) and precedes the verb. The P2 verb is not marked for voice but hosts a pronominal proclitic coding the actor. The sentence in (7) shows an example of a P2 construction. In this example notice that the undergoer buku ini, ‘this book’, is the pivot and thus precedes the verb, baca, ‘read’. The first person actor, ku, then appears as a proclitic on the verb.\n\n(7)\n\nBuku ini\n\nsudah ku=baca.\n\nbook DEM:prox PFCT 1sg=read\n\n‘I have read this book.’\n\n(adapted from Sneddon, 1996: 249)",

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

Foregrounded clauses are typically realis and are associated with perfective or telic aspect.\nHopper and Thompson (1980) also argue that passive clauses are associated with telic aspect. In passive clauses, the undergoer is conceptually salient and highly referential. According to Hopper and Thompson, this suggests that the undergoer is highly individuated, which in turn also means that the clause is high in transitivity. Another feature of clauses high in transitivity is that they are associated with telic aspect due to the degree of affectedness of the undergoer. Thus di- clauses in Minangkabau can be given a telic reading not because aspectual marking is a direct property of di-, but because di- clauses are high in transitivity.\n5.1.4 The Pasif Semu\nIn Standard Minangkabau, there is another kind of passive voice construction called the pasif semu (henceforth the P2 construction). Like a di- passive, the undergoer in a P2 construction performs the pivot function. However, unlike a di- passive, the actor in a P2 construction retains its status as a core argument. The P2 verb is unmarked yet the construction remains distinctive from a bare active construction because of the word order constraints it exhibits. However, due to the high frequency of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau, the P2 is not a distinctive construction in this variety (see Section 3.3 and Section 6.1.2.4).",

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’.

Further investigation is required to test this. However, a similar opposition also exists between the Standard Indonesian causative prefix per- and the applicative -kan. Alwi et al (1998) argue that the perverbs express an increase in the quality named by the stative verb root whereas the -kan verbs describe a complete change of state. So in Indonesian these two affixes encode similar processes: per- focuses on the origin of the event whereas -kan shows its end point.\nIn examples (203) to (206) the function of the prefix pa- is less easy to predict. In these examples pa- has a different semantic effect when it affixes to active verb roots aja, ‘teach’, duduak, ‘sit’, tagak, ‘stand’, and cuci, ‘wash’. The effect of applicative marking on each of these verbs is also different and this also has an effect on how pa- interacts with the applicatives.",

I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

Section 5.1.3.1 presents some data that illustrates how the passive voice marker di- is affected by the Sorba ludling. Since di- attaches to the word after the Sorba ludling transformations have taken place, the evidence suggests that di- is a proclitic.\nAffixation occurs at the word level of phonological representation, before the ludling operations take effect, whereas cliticisation occurs after all phonological processes that affect the word have taken place. These phonological behaviours reflect the fact that affixes function lexically and reflect semantic changes whereas clitics operate postlexically and are licensed as a result of syntactic processes (Anderson, 2005: 34; Zwicky, 1985). This distinction is important to make for Minangkabau in regards to the alternation between maN- and di-. Since processes affecting maN- affixation occur at the lexical level, this supports the idea that maN- has a lexical/derivational and semantic functions. The clitic di- on the other hand, is licensed by processes that occur post lexically, which supports the analysis of di- as having a primarily pragmatic and syntactic function. These ideas are supported by the finding that maN- functions as a part of Minangkabau’s non-pragmatically motivated voice system whereas di- does not (see Section 5.1.2.3).\n5.1.2.2 Syntactic Properties of maN-",

There is evidence to suggest that phrasal stress in Minangkabau is syllable final yet clitics are not affected by this tendency. For example, in (159a) stress falls on the final syllable of dimasak, which has been underlined and marked in bold in the example.

Basar and air become VTRs through suffixation of -kan and -i respectively, and as such they can become abstract nouns, i.e. nouns referring to the act or event as such in the same way as kirim ‘send’ (a VTR), viz. through affixation of poN-_ -an (6.7.3).

These are mainly due to the lack of information for some isolects, to the variety of methods used for describing data in the individual isolects, and to the inadequacy of some of these descriptions.

One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

Ambo maagiahan inyo pitih.\n1sg AV-give-APP 3 money\n‘I gave that guy money.’ (Elicitation)\nAnother feature of ditransitive verbs is that the recipient argument can be assigned core argument status and swap places with the undergoer argument. For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

Perhaps bare verb constructions don’t represent some kind of defective or underspecified version of a voice marked verb construction. Instead, they are used in cases where voice and semantic roles are not just underspecified, but unimportant. This is because ambiguity is a perfectly acceptable feature of Colloquial Minangkabau discourse. Gil (2002a; 2006) explores similar ideas\n211",

The verb gigik, ‘bite’, in (154) is transitive and therefore specifies an undergoer argument but in this example the undergoer argument is omitted and the verb is not marked for active voice. This means that “the semantic transitivity of the verb root is not represented” thus causing the clause to be ungrammatical (Fortin, 2001: 14). Although Fortin’s claims may represent the judgments of many Minangkabau speakers, the conversational data in the MPI EVA Minangkabau database reveals a different picture. Bare verbs are a systematic feature of Colloquial Minangkabau and sentences like (154) abound.

Nouns with core argument status are unmarked but their grammatical relation is determined by their relative position in the clause or by their referential status.

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

The appearance of pronominal post-verbal actor enclitics is a distinctive feature of passive clauses (see Section 5.1.3.2), so the syntax of this construction allows for only one interpretation; nyo must be the actor therefore the bare verb must be passive.\n\n(259) a. b. c.\n\nTanamnyo sawit.\n\nplant-3\n\npalm.oil.tree\n\n‘He planted palm oil trees.’\n\n(Text ID: 421384121144170706)\n\nDitanamnyo sawit.\n\nPV-plant-3\n\npalm.oil.tree\n\n‘He planted palm oil trees.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n*Mananamnyo sawit.\n\nAV-plant-3\n\npalm.oil.tree\n\n(Elicitation)\n193\n\n\fThere are also a number of ‘passive’ bare verbs in the MPI EVA corpus that appear in more loosely organised clauses.

The transitivity of verb roots is specified in the lexicon (this is also true of noun roots as well: see manggulai, ‘make a curry’, and manggandang, ‘beat on the drum’, in example (288)) and can only be increased by applicative formation. For example, a distinction is made in the lexicon between intransitive and transitive active verbs and applicative formation is required to increase the syntactic valency of the intransitive verb root (see Chapters 4 and 5). In addition to this, a lexical distinction is\n217",

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation. Yet, as examples (263), (264) and (265) show, even in ambiguous cases voice marking is not required.",

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

According to Langacker, nouns involve summary scanning; we need only to glance at an object summarily in order to tell what kind of object it is. Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way. He argues that verbs, on the other hand, involve change over time, therefore we supposedly perceive events in a sequential way; a snapshot view of a person mid-motion will not tell us if that person is standing, jumping, running, falling or involved in any number of other\n54",

The reduced forms of all pronouns often appear in casual discourse in place of the full forms. In this case, the difference is merely stylistic. Pronouns that do not have a reduced form are used in full to show possession but cannot be cliticised to the passive voice verb.\n\nMinangkabau speakers also often substitute first and second person pronouns with personal names or epithets. Names are used to show solidarity towards addressees younger than the speaker or between speakers and addressees of the same age group. Epithets are based on kinship terms and are used to show politeness. Their use is determined by the addressee’s generational age, i.e. whether they are a child, a young adult, a parent-aged adult or a grandparent-aged adult, and the speaker’s age in relation to the addressee. For example, if I were speaking to a younger child I would refer to them by their name or by the epithet adik, ‘child’, and refer to myself as uni, ‘older\n10 Awak, or wak, is also sometimes used to refer to the first person singular.

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-.

Jacobson, 1979; Swadesh, 1939), Salishan languages (cf. Jelinek and Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) and Polynesian languages (cf. Broschart, 1997; Mosel and Hovdhaugen, 1992) are said to lack a noun-verb distinction; therefore it cannot be said that the primitive features [±noun] and [±verb] are underlying in these languages. Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52",

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot.

He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

According to Langacker, nouns involve summary scanning; we need only to glance at an object summarily in order to tell what kind of object it is. Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way. He argues that verbs, on the other hand, involve change over time, therefore we supposedly perceive events in a sequential way; a snapshot view of a person mid-motion will not tell us if that person is standing, jumping, running, falling or involved in any number of other\n54",

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

Generally speaking, paN- and par- and their correspondences both refer to the actor of a performance, to the instrument with which the action is performed, or, with VSIs, to someone or something having the quality of (VSI) as a characteristic.

Kroeger, 1998), Minangkabau does not have any lexical specifications about a verb’s ‘default’ pivot or its basic voice. This idea is supported by the fact that, when bare verbs are used in place of voice marked verbs, the ‘voice’ of the verb and the semantic roles of the verb’s arguments are underspecified (see Section 6.1.2). This suggests that some elements of the verb’s argument structure are dependent on the surface realisation of syntactic structures and voice morphology on the verb. Rather than claiming that the unmarked verb is precategorial, we can propose that some aspects of its argument structure in Minangkabau are underspecified (see Section 6.3.2). We could also propose a solution similar to Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) and argue that some elements of argument structure are specified by the verb root and other elements are specified by the voice marker. The interaction of root with voice marker and the effects that this has on argument structure must depend on the category and semantics of the root.\n6.3.1.2 Nominalisation Processes\nAs discussed in Section 4.2.1.2, Minangkabau has productive nominalising morphology and makes use of three main nominalising affixes: pa-, paN-, and -an. Like many of the nominalising affixes used in Philippine-type languages, two of the Minangkabau nominalisers, pa- and -an, are apparently homophonous with verbal morphological markers: the causative prefix pa- and the applicative -an respectively (see Section 6.3.1.3). The examples in (285) show how pa- and -an affect the verbal roots to create phonologically identical nominal and verbal forms.\n218\n\n\f(285) ROOT\na. tanam b. tolong c. tamu d. ingek\n\n‘plant’ ‘help’ ‘meet’ ‘remember’",

Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT).

Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.",

This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source).

According to De Casparis -ma:mu is a second person possessive pronoun (De Casparis 1956:35), -ta is “probably a second person polite form” (p.21), and -da (/-nda after vowels) is “a honorific equivalent of na” (p.3).

Compare anak-da or ana-nda, ibu-nda, bapa-nda, cucu-nda, etc. As cliticised pronominal forms were already attested for PMP (Blust 1977a: 11), it is likely that PM had them as well, and that -ma:mu, -ta, and -(n)da are reflexes of these clitics. But it is not clear whether -ma:mu already occurred in PM as a suffix in its present shape or whether it was a complex form which developed into a single suffix after PM.

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb. In (51c) the prefixation of the active voice marker maN- creates a change of state verb from the root word and in (51d) the addition of the applicative –an derives a transitive, causative verb.\n\n(51) a.\n\nBaju itame tu\n\nnan gaek-gaek tu.\n\nshirt black-3 DEM:dist REL RED-old DEM:dist\n\n‘The old people wear black shirts.’\n\n(Text ID: 445038115055260406)\n73",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

Noun plurals are created by reduplicating the substantive word (although a single non-reduplicated noun root can also be interpreted as plural if the context requires it). Example (23) shows how the noun root sanak, ‘sibling’, is reduplicated to indicate plurality.\n\n60\n\n\f(23)\n\nSanak-sank den.\n\nRED-sibling 1sg\n\n‘My siblings.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

In fact, using prototype theory and the conceptual, cognitive and functional definitions for parts of speech discussed in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2 as a guiding framework to describe parts of speech in Minangkabau, I argue that Minangkabau clearly has a class of object words (nouns) and a class of action words (verbs) but that both classes can be used in non-prototypical ways (see Sections 4.2.1.1 and 4.2.1.2). Minangkabau also has a class of ‘property words’, but since these property words are used to predicate I argue that they represent a sub-type of stative verb. As well as nouns and verbs I also argue that Minangkabau has a class of adverbs, which are discussed in Section 4.2.1.3. Nouns, verbs and adverbs are open class items, but Minangkabau also has a number of closed class items including pronouns, prepositions, specifiers, negators, TAM adverbials and pragmatic particles. Closed class items are discussed in Section 4.2.2.\n58",

He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Gil (2000: 192) argues that similar constructions\n63\n\n\fin Malay, for example rumah Bobok, ‘Bobok’s house’ are in fact nominative attributive constructions. This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively.

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source).

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf.

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

Minangkabau also has a class of ‘property words’, but since these property words are used to predicate I argue that they represent a sub-type of stative verb. As well as nouns and verbs I also argue that Minangkabau has a class of adverbs, which are discussed in Section 4.2.1.3. Nouns, verbs and adverbs are open class items, but Minangkabau also has a number of closed class items including pronouns, prepositions, specifiers, negators, TAM adverbials and pragmatic particles.

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them.

In (21a) notice that the verb is followed by the actor, the first person pronoun aku, and then the patient, laser, ‘ a laser’. However, in (21b) the verb is followed by the patient, nasi goreng, ‘fried rice’, and then the actor, aku.",

Thus, for Shibatani, although active voice indicates a pragmatically motivated opposition to passive voice, it also has conceptual underpinnings. The Minangkabau active voice marker maN- also occupies this intersection between semantics and pragmatics and also functions to show the development of an action. In Colloquial Minangkabau the functional load of maN- is primarily semantic since it is not used to mark a pragmatic voice distinction (see Chapter 6).\n\nThere is also evidence to support an analysis of meN- in Malay/Indonesian as a semantic/conceptual device used to mark aspectual notions. Hopper’s (1979) work argues that the foregrounding and backgrounding of events in Classical Malay discourse is achieved through voice marking, whereas other languages achieve this through various other strategies including tense-aspect marking on the verb, word order, and\n131",

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb. In (51c) the prefixation of the active voice marker maN- creates a change of state verb from the root word and in (51d) the addition of the applicative –an derives a transitive, causative verb.\n\n(51) a.\n\nBaju itame tu\n\nnan gaek-gaek tu.\n\nshirt black-3 DEM:dist REL RED-old DEM:dist\n\n‘The old people wear black shirts.’\n\n(Text ID: 445038115055260406)\n73",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

Example (27) shows number marking, examples (28) and (29) show how numerical classifiers work, examples (30), (31) and (32) show how possession is marked, example (33) shows how nouns can also be modified by attributive nouns, and examples (34) and (35) show the use of demonstratives.\n\nExample (27) shows a Minangkabau noun that is marked for number. Number is not morphologically marked in Minangkabau, instead numerals precede the noun. Example (27) illustrates this; the noun taun, year, is preceded by the numeral tigo.\n\n(27)\n\nLai tigo taun lebih kurang.\n\nmore three year more less\n\n‘More or less three years ago.’\n\n(Text ID: 979548152848070306)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also marked by numerical classifiers. Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

This then allows for a distinction to be made between stative verbs, which are not gradable, and a special class of property words that are gradable (Steinhauer, 2008). In fact, property words crosslinguistically are comparative, i.e. gradable (Anderson, 1985; Croft, 1991; Dixon, 1982; Schachter, 1985), which stative verbs are not. In Minangkabau, property words are gradable too, as example (50) shows; the comparative prefix sa- on gadang, ‘big’, shows that gadang is gradable. According to Langacker’s (1987b) terminology, this\n9 Rumah Gadang translates literally as ‘big house’ but the term is actually used to refer to the distinctive Minangkabau traditional houses with pointed curved rooves intended to signify the horns of a water buffalo.\n72\n\n\fmeans that gadang is relational and therefore notionally an adjective. However, as we established in Section 4.1.2.1, stative verbs can also be construed as relational since their meaning is framed against a polar opposite.\n\n(50)\n\nBulek-bulek sagadang talua puyuah.\n\nRED-round COMP-big egg quail\n\n‘It is round and as big as a quail’s egg.’\n\n(Text ID: 217881132319230306)",

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

Crowley, 2002), nor does it have regular diminutive forming processes.\n\nSome examples of these formal properties of Minangkabau nouns follow in examples (27) to (35). Example (27) shows number marking, examples (28) and (29) show how numerical classifiers work, examples (30), (31) and (32) show how possession is marked, example (33) shows how nouns can also be modified by attributive nouns, and examples (34) and (35) show the use of demonstratives.\n\nExample (27) shows a Minangkabau noun that is marked for number. Number is not morphologically marked in Minangkabau, instead numerals precede the noun.

Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source). Nor do I have an explanation for the IBN demonstratives (note their agreement with Tagalog, which has itð referring to things close to the speaker).",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

In Minangkabau, possession is not morphologically marked on the noun. Instead, the verb punyo, ‘have’, is used to show a possessive relationship between the possessor and the possessed (see example (30)). Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo. Similarly in (32), mainan, ‘toy’, is marked for possession by NP anak tu, ‘the child’.\n\n(30)\n\nPunyo den ma.\n\nhave 1sg EMPH\n\n‘It’s mine.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(31) (32)\n\nInyo manyikek abuaknyo.\n3 AV-brush hair-3\n‘She brushed her hair.’\n(Elicitation)\nMainan anak tu.\nplay-NOM child DEM:dist\n‘The child’s toy.’\n(Elicitation)\n\nIt is important to note that the constructions in (31) and (32) cannot be described exclusively as genitive constructions.

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970).

As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs.

Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention.

Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

In addition to this, inflected verb forms can also function as NP heads without any change to their morphological marking.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf.

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes.

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

According to Langacker, nouns involve summary scanning; we need only to glance at an object summarily in order to tell what kind of object it is. Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way. He argues that verbs, on the other hand, involve change over time, therefore we supposedly perceive events in a sequential way; a snapshot view of a person mid-motion will not tell us if that person is standing, jumping, running, falling or involved in any number of other\n54",

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

The MIN and BH forms are problematic: they may have have developed from a morphologically complex pre-PM form *i-ni-ia, or from a (post-?) PM combination *ia + *na with contraction of *ia to i (or to a in MIN ano/ano; pronouns are often subject to irregular shortening and contraction), cf. SM diana ‘(3rd pers. sg./pl.)’ (Gerth van Wijk p.221; Klinkert). *ia was reconstructed for the third person singular (3.4.2.6), which is also in agreement with PMP *si-ia (Blust 1977a: 11).\nA cliticised form of the third person is SM, BH -na, MIN -no/-no/-o/-e; in IBN the full form is used. SM, MIN, BH, SWY, and JKT reflect *-na; the PMP ancestral form of *-na is *ni-a (Blust 1977a:10-l 1) in which a merger of the alveolar nasal with following *i into a palatal nasal had not yet taken place. Some isolects have a third person plural pronoun. One of these, IBN sida?, reflects PMP *si-iDa (Blust 1977a: 11), and PM *sida ? is reconstructed.\nThe other pronouns are later developments: SM məreka (itu)/marika (itu) does not occur in early Classical Malay texts, nor does it have correspondences in other isolects that are not felt to be originally SM. Marika is described as ‘a people’ in Howison (1801) and as ‘people, persons; an armour-bearer, esquire’ in Marsden (1812). It may be borrowed from Old Javanese, which has marika, an emphatic article which apparently also functioned as a*\nvery likely, but the connection of b- with +(a)ba is too conjectural.

OM has three other postcliticised personal pronouns. According to De Casparis -ma:mu is a second person possessive pronoun (De Casparis 1956:35), -ta is “probably a second person polite form” (p.21), and -da (/-nda after vowels) is “a honorific equivalent of na” (p.3). A semantic shift from first person plural (incl.) to second person was already shown in BRU kita7 ‘(2nd pers. polite)’, IBN and SAR kita7 ‘(2nd pers. pl.)’ < *kita 7 (3.2.3). -(n)da is also found in SM, where it became a polite style marker suffixed to kinship terms in (archaic) formal language (especially in letter writing). Compare anak-da or ana-nda, ibu-nda, bapa-nda, cucu-nda, etc. As cliticised pronominal forms were already attested for PMP (Blust 1977a: 11), it is likely that PM had them as well, and that -ma:mu, -ta, and -(n)da are reflexes of these clitics. But it is not clear whether -ma:mu already occurred in PM as a suffix in its present shape or whether it was a complex form which developed into a single suffix after PM.

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’.

But an original *agkau( 7) cannot account for dikaw, nor for MIN kau ‘you (to women)’ or BH kau ‘you’ (Asfandi Adul) 1976:145-146); dikaw must have developed from ^ikauC7) (with diphthongisation of *-au-, and prefixation of *(d)i-), or from *kau( 7) (with prefixation of *di-, and subsequent diphthongisation of *-au-).

As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs.

Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives).

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source).

The vowel difference in the pair əŋkaw and dikaw raises the question whether *agkau( 7), *kau( 7), or *ikau( 7) must be reconstructed. Both *agkau(7) and *ikau( 7) would result in SM əŋkaw, the latter after (1) antepenultimate neutralisation and (2) nasal insertion between initial ə and following stop (4.2 + fn.128). In each case the last vowel wotɪld have become a diphthong to yield a disyllabic form. But an original *agkau( 7) cannot account for dikaw, nor for MIN kau ‘you (to women)’ or BH kau ‘you’ (Asfandi Adul) 1976:145-146); dikaw must have developed from ^ikauC7) (with diphthongisation of *-au-, and prefixation of *(d)i-), or from *kau( 7) (with prefixation of *di-, and subsequent diphthongisation of *-au-). But the reconstruction of ^ikauC7) assumes (unexplained) loss of the initial vowel in MIN and BH (where kau occurs).\nMost likely, *kau( 7) was the ancestor of SM əŋ/kaw, di/kaw, MIN, BH kau, and SM əŋ/kaw acquired an epenthetic aN- after its disyllabicity was lost in fast speech.\n\n5.5.1.1 First person\n\n*aku ‘(1st pers. sg.)’ was reconstructed on the basis of evidence from four isolects\n\n(3.4.2.6).

OM has three other postcliticised personal pronouns. According to De Casparis -ma:mu is a second person possessive pronoun (De Casparis 1956:35), -ta is “probably a second person polite form” (p.21), and -da (/-nda after vowels) is “a honorific equivalent of na” (p.3).

Compare anak-da or ana-nda, ibu-nda, bapa-nda, cucu-nda, etc. As cliticised pronominal forms were already attested for PMP (Blust 1977a: 11), it is likely that PM had them as well, and that -ma:mu, -ta, and -(n)da are reflexes of these clitics. But it is not clear whether -ma:mu already occurred in PM as a suffix in its present shape or whether it was a complex form which developed into a single suffix after PM.

SWY dio, JKT die may originally have had a distribution parallel to that of SM dia; it is also possible that they were borrowed from SM. The MIN and BH forms are problematic: they may have have developed from a morphologically complex pre-PM form *i-ni-ia, or from a (post-?) PM combination *ia + *na with contraction of *ia to i (or to a in MIN ano/ano; pronouns are often subject to irregular shortening and contraction), cf. SM diana ‘(3rd pers. sg./pl.)’ (Gerth van Wijk p.221; Klinkert). *ia was reconstructed for the third person singular (3.4.2.6), which is also in agreement with PMP *si-ia (Blust 1977a: 11).\nA cliticised form of the third person is SM, BH -na, MIN -no/-no/-o/-e; in IBN the full form is used. SM, MIN, BH, SWY, and JKT reflect *-na; the PMP ancestral form of *-na is *ni-a (Blust 1977a:10-l 1) in which a merger of the alveolar nasal with following *i into a palatal nasal had not yet taken place. Some isolects have a third person plural pronoun. One of these, IBN sida?, reflects PMP *si-iDa (Blust 1977a: 11), and PM *sida ? is reconstructed.\nThe other pronouns are later developments: SM məreka (itu)/marika (itu) does not occur in early Classical Malay texts, nor does it have correspondences in other isolects that are not felt to be originally SM. Marika is described as ‘a people’ in Howison (1801) and as ‘people, persons; an armour-bearer, esquire’ in Marsden (1812). It may be borrowed from Old Javanese, which has marika, an emphatic article which apparently also functioned as a*\nvery likely, but the connection of b- with +(a)ba is too conjectural.

As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

                "content": "As we saw in Section 4.2.1.2, adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood are not encoded morphologically on the verb, rather they are realised as distinct lexical items that precede the verb. These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

In Minangkabau, possession is not morphologically marked on the noun. Instead, the verb punyo, ‘have’, is used to show a possessive relationship between the possessor and the possessed (see example (30)). Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo. Similarly in (32), mainan, ‘toy’, is marked for possession by NP anak tu, ‘the child’.\n\n(30)\n\nPunyo den ma.\n\nhave 1sg EMPH\n\n‘It’s mine.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(31) (32)\n\nInyo manyikek abuaknyo.\n3 AV-brush hair-3\n‘She brushed her hair.’\n(Elicitation)\nMainan anak tu.\nplay-NOM child DEM:dist\n‘The child’s toy.’\n(Elicitation)\n\nIt is important to note that the constructions in (31) and (32) cannot be described exclusively as genitive constructions.

According to Langacker, nouns involve summary scanning; we need only to glance at an object summarily in order to tell what kind of object it is. Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way. He argues that verbs, on the other hand, involve change over time, therefore we supposedly perceive events in a sequential way; a snapshot view of a person mid-motion will not tell us if that person is standing, jumping, running, falling or involved in any number of other\n54",

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source). Nor do I have an explanation for the IBN demonstratives (note their agreement with Tagalog, which has itð referring to things close to the speaker).",

Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT). Fourthly, the syntactical role of SM paN- and MIN paN- is quite different from the (more restricted) role of their correspondences in other isolects.

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

Because the applicative has not been used, most speakers of Standard Minangkabau would label this example ungrammatical and prefer the verb mambaoan instead. However, the existence of this example shows that the applicative is not always required to create a ‘dative’ construction in Colloquial Minangkabau.\n175",

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’.

Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo.

                "content": "Acehnese has a system of pronominal marking on its verbs which cross-references the agent and undergoer arguments. Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

In a typical transitive clause an active transitive verb root functions as the head and is marked by the active voice prefix maN-. Adjuncts do not form part of the predicate’s core argument structure and are marked by a preposition. Like active intransitives, active transitive predicates can be marked by the active voice marker maN-. Example (96) illustrates a canonical active transitive clause with the active transitive predicate mancuci, ‘wash’. Notice that sabun, ‘soap’, is marked by the preposition jo because it is an adjunct.\n\n(96)\n\nInyo mancuci tangannyo jo sabun.\n\n3 AV-wash hand-3\n\nwith soap\n\n‘He washed his hands with soap.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Notice that the verb is marked by both the proclitic ji, which is co-referential with the (null) agent, and the enclitic geuh, which is coreferential with the undergoer, gopnyan, ‘he’. In Acehnese transitive verbs, the agents are compulsorily referenced by proclitics whereas undergoers are only optionally referenced by enclitics. The presence of undergoer enclitics implies that the undergoer is topical therefore it is rare to have a undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is topical (Durie, 1985a: 201-06). In example (15) the undergoer is indeed topical since the agent is not overtly expressed. Notice also that the undergoer appears before the verb. The ability to appear in pre-verbal position is a property of Core Topics in Acehnese (see below).\n\nSince both active and stative verbs can be either agent oriented or undergoer oriented, Durie (1985a) argues that the split between agent oriented verbs and undergoer oriented verbs is instead defined according to the semantic notions of control and de-control. If a verb takes an agent, the ultimate initiator of the event, it is a controlled verb, whereas if a verb takes an undergoer, the participant that is ultimately affected by the event, then it is a de-controlled verb (Durie, 1985a: 55-56). Table 4 shows some examples of agent oriented (i.e. controlled) verbs and undergoer oriented (i.e. de-controlled) verbs. Notice that both the controlled and de-controlled categories include verbs which are semantically active and verbs which are semantically stative.\n\n32\n\n\fTable 4.

For example, in (49) notice that the ‘property word’ gadang, ‘big’, is used\nboth attributively and predicatively. In (49a) gadang is used attributively to modify the\nnoun rumah, ‘house’. In (49b) gadang functions as the predicate. Notice that when\nfunctioning predicatively gadang remains unmarked. In Minangkabau, stative verbs are\nalso unmarked by verbal morphology when used predicatively. Like property words,\nunmarked stative verbs can also be used attributively (see Section 4.3.2.1).\n7 There is also a division of activity verbs based on the semantic transitivity of their root. Minangkabau has three classes of activity verbs: intransitive active verbs (i.e. active intransitives), transitive verbs and ditransitive verbs (see Section 4.3.2.). 8 Minangkabau also has a small class of semelfactive verbs which, like stative verbs, cannot take the active voice prefix maN-, but unlike stative verbs, can appear in progressive constructions (see example (i), which shows the semelfactive verb batuak, ‘cough’).

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo.

According to Schachter (1976; 1977), in Philippine-type languages, there is a division of these role and reference related properties of subjects between the actor and the pivot. The reference related properties of subjects, such as the ability to be relativised and to launch floating quantifiers, correspond most closely to the function of the pivot, whereas the role related properties are performed by the actor participant, whether the actor is aligned with the pivot function or not (see below).\n\nFoley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) argue that voice in Philippine-type languages constitutes a realignment between the grammatical function of pivot and semantic role. This means that voice marking on the verb changes according to the semantic role of the participant that is selected to be the pivot. Philippine-type languages are conservative (when compared to Indonesian-type languages) and have rich voice systems that allow for a range of different participant types to be selected as pivot (Ross, 2002).\n\nTagalog is described as having four voices, as example (5) demonstrates.\n\n(5) a. b. c. d.\n\nMag-salis\n\nang babae ng bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nACT:TOP-will-take-out TOP woman GOAL rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘The woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisin\n\nng babae ang bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nGOAL:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman TOP rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take the rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisan\n\nng babae ng bigasang sako para.sa bata.\n\nDIR:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice TOP sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of the sack for a/the child.’\n\nIpag-salis\n\nng babae ng bigas sa sako ang bata.\n\nBENF:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice DIR sack TOP child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for the child.’",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

To illustrate this, consider example (70). This example is similar in meaning and structure to (69), except that in (70) the locative phrase di tampek gulo, ‘in the sugar container’, is the head.\n\n(70)\n\nBanyak samuik di tampek gulo.\n\nmany ant\n\nLOC place sugar\n\n‘Lots of ants are in the sugar container.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSimilarly in (71), the locative phrase di belakang rumah den, ‘behind my house’, is the head (see Section 4.3.1.4).\n\n(71)\n\nBanyak batang pisang di balakang rumah den.\n\nmany trunk banana LOC behind\n\nhouse 1sg\n\n‘Many banana trees are behind my house.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nExample (72) illustrates a possessive construction which has the possessive verb punyo as its head. This type of construction is a sub-type of existential constructions (Lyons, 1995) and is transitive. In (72) the first person aden is the pivot and duo anak, ‘two children’, is the possessed NP.\n\n(72)\n\nAden punyo duo anak.\n\n1sg have two child\n\n‘I have two children.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n4.3.1.4 Locative Predicates\n\nLocative predicates do not contain a prototypical Minangkabau verb, instead a locative phrase (which consists of a locative preposition and an NP) functions as the head (see\n86\n\n\fexamples (70) and (71)). Like verbal predicates, locative predicates can also be modified by preceding adverbials, including negators and TAM adverbials.\n\nAn example of a locative predicate can be found in (73). In this example the locative phrase ka rumah den, ‘to my house’, is the head.\n\n(73)\n\nInyo alun ka rumah den.\n\n3\n\nnot.yet to house 1sg\n\n‘He hasn't been to my house yet.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

In Minangkabau, possession is not morphologically marked on the noun. Instead, the verb punyo, ‘have’, is used to show a possessive relationship between the possessor and the possessed (see example (30)). Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo. Similarly in (32), mainan, ‘toy’, is marked for possession by NP anak tu, ‘the child’.\n\n(30)\n\nPunyo den ma.\n\nhave 1sg EMPH\n\n‘It’s mine.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(31) (32)\n\nInyo manyikek abuaknyo.\n3 AV-brush hair-3\n‘She brushed her hair.’\n(Elicitation)\nMainan anak tu.\nplay-NOM child DEM:dist\n‘The child’s toy.’\n(Elicitation)\n\nIt is important to note that the constructions in (31) and (32) cannot be described exclusively as genitive constructions.

The answer is that verbs can function referentially but that they are morphologically marked when\n\n74\n\n\fthey do so. This would indicate that predication really is an inherent, prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that reference is a non-prototypical function.\n\nExamples (52), (53) and (54) illustrate how verbs can be used referentiality with the use of the nominalising affixes -an, pa- and paN-. In (52) the noun tanaman, ‘plant’, is derived from the verb root tanam, ‘to plant’, in combination with the nominalising affix -an. The noun parampok, ‘thief’, in (53) makes use of the agentive nominaliser pa- to derive the form from the verb root rampok, ‘rob, steal’. The nominaliser -an is also used in (54) in combination with the paN- nominaliser to derive the noun panyalasaian, ‘ending’, from the verb root salasai, ‘finish’.

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

To illustrate this, consider example (70). This example is similar in meaning and structure to (69), except that in (70) the locative phrase di tampek gulo, ‘in the sugar container’, is the head.\n\n(70)\n\nBanyak samuik di tampek gulo.\n\nmany ant\n\nLOC place sugar\n\n‘Lots of ants are in the sugar container.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSimilarly in (71), the locative phrase di belakang rumah den, ‘behind my house’, is the head (see Section 4.3.1.4).\n\n(71)\n\nBanyak batang pisang di balakang rumah den.\n\nmany trunk banana LOC behind\n\nhouse 1sg\n\n‘Many banana trees are behind my house.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nExample (72) illustrates a possessive construction which has the possessive verb punyo as its head.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively.

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class. However, this distinction is not captured by Chomsky’s (1970) classification framework.\n\n(22) a. John pounded the metal flat.\n\n(AP)\n\nb. John threw the ball into the barrel.

In this example it is interpreted as ditransitive. The recipient participant den, ‘me’, appears in core argument position even though an applicative has not been used to license a recipient participant. Because the applicative has not been used, most speakers of Standard Minangkabau would label this example ungrammatical and prefer the verb mambaoan instead. However, the existence of this example shows that the applicative is not always required to create a ‘dative’ construction in Colloquial Minangkabau.\n175",

Like verbal predicates, locative predicates can also be modified by preceding adverbials, including negators and TAM adverbials.\n\nAn example of a locative predicate can be found in (73). In this example the locative phrase ka rumah den, ‘to my house’, is the head.\n\n(73)\n\nInyo alun ka rumah den.\n\n3\n\nnot.yet to house 1sg\n\n‘He hasn't been to my house yet.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

In this case, the syntactic frame can be described as a more general ‘predicate construction’ with a predicate (‘PRED’) as its head. The predicate construction is represented in (39) and described in further detail in Section 4.3.\n(39) Predicate Construction =\n((NP) → (negator) → (TAM) → (voice marking)-PRED-(applicative) → (adverb) → (NP))\nMinangkabau verbs also display many of the formal properties of verbs described by Anderson (1985). These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes. Table 10 lists each of these formal properties of verbs and describes how these properties are realised in Minangkabau.\n67\n\n\fTable 10.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

                "content": "Chapter 5 describes the Minangkabau system of voice and verbal morphology. In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

Perhaps bare verb constructions don’t represent some kind of defective or underspecified version of a voice marked verb construction.

Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

First, the characterisation of voice relies heavily on the nature of grammatical relations in the language. Second, in addition to the syntactic processes that motivate voice, it is also essential to consider the motivating discourse/pragmatic factors involved. Third, as well as encoding syntactic distinctions, voice marking may also encode semantic and conceptual distinctions such as aspectual notions. This third issue is especially important to consider for pivotless languages like Acehnese, since ‘voice’ marking does not encode grammatical relations in this kind of language. These theoretical themes also heavily inform my characterisation of the syntactic, discourse/pragmatic, and semantic properties of voice in Minangkabau (see Chapter 5).\n40\n\n\f41",

The other participants in the clause are marked by articles that show their semantic role; for example the benefactor bata, ‘child’, is marked by the benefactive composite para sa and so on.\nSentences (5b), (5c) and (5d) show the three other Tagalog voice types. In (5b) the verb is marked for goal voice, meaning that the goal bigas, ‘rice’, is the pivot. In (5c) the direction is the pivot therefore the verb is marked for locative voice, and in (5d) the benefactor is pivot therefore the verb is marked for benefactive voice.\nAn additional typologically salient feature of Philippine-type voice systems is that they are symmetrical (Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2005; 2008). This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6). Thus, voice marking in Philippine-type languages also has a verbal derivational function.\n2.2 Indonesian-type Voice",

However, unlike Philippine-type languages, which allow for a range of participant types to be assigned pivot status, in Indonesiantype languages voice alternation centres around the alignment of the pivot function with either the actor or the undergoer (cf. Klamer, 1996). If the actor is selected as the pivot then the verb is marked for active voice, however if the undergoer is selected as the pivot then the verb is marked for passive voice.\n21",

Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice. The sentences in (21) show two Riau Indonesian ‘neutral’ constructions in which the verb beli, ‘buy’, is unmarked.\n\n(21) a.\n\nBeli aku laser, kan.\nbuy 1sg laser Q\n‘I’ll buy a laser, right.’ [Context: Contemplating a shopping trip.]\n\n38\n\n\fb.

The referential saliency of arguments can also be determined by the pragmatic effects of contrastive focus (Arka, 2003a).\n\nTo test the effects of contrastive focus on pivot selection in Minangkabau I asked my language consultants the question in (113a), ‘sia nan mambali oto baru?’, ‘who bought a new car?’, and added that they should imagine that I already knew that it was either Udin or somebody else. This meant that their answer would then provide contrastive focus between the two possible answers. In (113b) the answer Udin is given, but this answer should be understood in context; i.e. it was Udin that bought the new car (rather than somebody else). Since the answer Udin provides contrastive focus, this means that Udin the NP is referentially salient and therefore selected as the pivot. This in turn triggers active voice marking on the verb since Udin is an actor. Notice that although (113c) is grammatically well formed, in this context it is infelicitous (as shown by the # symbol). This because the NP oto baru, ‘a new car’, has been selected as the pivot even though it is not the most referentially salient argument.\n\n(113) a.\n\nSia nan mambali oto baru?\nwho REL AV-buy car new\n‘Who bought a new car?’ [Udin or somebody else?]\n\nb.

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”",

Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

However, the pervasive use of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau have meant that the properties that make the P2 construction distinct in Standard Minangkabau do not apply in Colloquial Minangkabau. In fact, the evidence suggests that the P2 construction has merged with the bare active construction in the Colloquial variety.\n\nAs described in Section 5.1.4, the P2 construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau has a restrictive set of word order constraints. In Standard Minangkabau, nothing must intervene between the actor and the verb in a P2 clause, therefore all auxiliaries (i.e. negators and TAM adverbials) must precede the actor, whereas in a Standard Minangkabau active sentence, auxiliaries can intervene between the actor and the verb. In fact, if these clausal components occurred before the actor NP, then the sentence’s acceptability would be very much reduced. We do not find these word order constraints in Colloquial Minangkabau and in fact find that clauses with bare verbs allow both ‘auxiliary + actor’ and ‘actor + auxiliary’ word orders.\n\nFor example, consider the sentences in (266) which show that there are no constraints on the ordering of the actor NP and the auxiliary components in an active clause.\n\n(266) a. b. c.\n\nInyo acok ubah gayanyo.\n3 often change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo ubah gayanyo.\noften 3 change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo maubah gayanyo.\noften 3 AV-change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\n(Elicitation)\n\n199",

Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT).

Conducting elicitation was an essential stage in the process of understanding these bare verb forms because I was able to ask speakers about the restrictions on using these bare forms and also to test the productivity and use of these forms in syntactic and pragmatic contexts not found in the corpus.\n5 An Aqiqa is a Muslim ceremony in which a new born baby is named. 45",

This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2).

Whether JKT had three demonstratives is uncertain: the sources are not clear as to whether onð is a variant of itu/tu/tð, or is in series with it (and with ini/ni). OM has inan ‘that’ (Qoedes 1930:66). This agrees with the MIN locative s/inan, and points to *inan ‘yonder’ along with *(i)ni(?) ‘this’ and ^i)tuθ ‘that’. Another possibility is that the last part of the reflexes for ‘yonder’ in SM, BH, and SWY (di-s/ana, s/ana, and s/ano respectively) reflect PM *ana(7) ‘that (yonder)’. (JKT ðnð must be borrowed because of the irregular vowel correspondences).\nMore dialect material is required to determine the shape of this third demonstrative pronoun, and for the time being I reconstruct *(i)ni(?) ‘this’, ^i)tuθ ‘that’ and *(i)na(n) or *(a)na(?) ‘that (over there)’. The final *(n) in *(i)na(n) was possibly a suffix, which would unify this form with *(a)na( ?). The origin of MIN iko (ko) is unclear (in JV ika occurs, but this means ‘that (yonder)’ and is probably not a source). Nor do I have an explanation for the IBN demonstratives (note their agreement with Tagalog, which has itð referring to things close to the speaker).",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

In final position it agrees in all isolects except MIN, which has a corresponding 0. But if a corresponding MIN form is suffixed with -i or -an, a morphophonological -1- reappears (2.2.2 B). PM initial and intervocalic */ is reconstructed on the basis of / in all isolects, and PM final *1 is reconstructed on the basis of SM, BH, SWY, IBN, JKT -/, MIN -0 (or -/- at morpheme boundaries). Initial and intervocalic r agrees in all isolects but SWY, which has a corresponding r and x. Final r agrees in all isolects but MIN and SWY. MIN has a corresponding 0, and SWY a corresponding x and r. If a corresponding MIN form is suffixed with -i or -an, a morphophonemic -r- reappears (2.2.2 B). As to SWY x and r, the question arises whether they are reflexes of proto­ phonemes that have merged everywhere else in the isolects, or whether their distinction is an innovation. In the latter case they may be the result of a split, or one of them is a loan phoneme. For PMP, a velar */? and an apical trill *r were reconstructed. If these proto­ phonemes really existed (which recent research has been making increasingly doubtful), they must have merged in the Malayic isolects. At any rate, SWY x and rdo not reflect the distinction between *R and *r: it turns out that x is inherited, and that r is a loan phoneme.\nCompare the following list which contains all PMP lexical items with */? and *rfrom the 200-item basic wordlist (Blust forthcoming) that have a SWY reflex (where the SWY reflex differs semantically from PMP, the meaning of this reflex is added next to it):",

Nasalisation of actor-oriented verbs, affixation of the nominalising affixes paN- and paNan, yield the following alternations:\n\n(1) velar nasal accretion for initial vowels, e.g.\n\n(adil): (ikat): (ukur):\n\nŋadili ‘give judgement’, paŋadilan ‘law court’ rpkat‘bind’, pəŋikat‘s.th. to bind’ ŋukur‘measure’, pəŋukur‘measurer, gauger’\n\n(2) homorganic nasal substitution for initial stops, e.g.\n\n(potfi(h)): (pikul): (bali): (buka7): (dagax): (dapat): (timbo): (tufijiP7): (cukur): (jaliŋ): (jait): (kapur) (in (kildr): (gundal): (gantuŋ):\n\nHelfrich\n\nkapux):\n\nmotp(h) ‘make white’ pamikul ‘s.o. carrying a yoke’ mali ‘buy’ pəmuka 7 ‘entrepreneur’ nayax ‘hear’ pənapat ‘opinion’ nimbo ‘bale (water)’ pənunju37 ‘pointer’ nukiir ‘shave’, pafiukur ‘barber’ nəliŋ ‘look sidelong, squint’ panait ‘dressmaker, n*eedle ŋapur ‘whitewash’ pərpjdr‘a file’ ŋundali ‘throw at (s.th.)’ pəŋantuŋan ‘place to hang s.th.’\n\nN.B. As the above examples show, in Aliana et al. stops become homorganic nasals. Helfrich, however, is vague about the exact nature of nasalisation of stops, but from his examples it appears that voiceless stops usually become homorganic nasals, and that voiced stops usually have homorganic nasal accretion. Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.",

I was able to point out that some of the isolects still show retentions that were lost in SM. Among other things, JKT final-syllable schwa was shown to be a retention from PMP, and a corresponding schwa was reconstructed for PM. A further consequence of the fact that JKT schwa is a retention (rather than a loan phoneme) is that if lexemes in Malayic isolects have a corresponding form with a final syllable schwa in Javanese, this form may have been borrowed from JKT into Javanese. There are at any rate no grounds for automatically assuming that the Javanese correspondence must be inherited on account of its final-syllable schwa. It may turn out to be an original Malayic lexeme that came into Javanese through JKT, or through another Malayic isolect which retained schwa in an earlier stage. This may eventually throw new light on the mutual influence that Malayic isolects and Javanese exercised on one another. It was also demonstrated that, although there is a r/x distinction in SWY, this does not reflect the alleged PMP *rR/ distinction, and that SWY ris an innovation.\nThe study of PM word structure has yielded some insights which I hope will prove to be useful as a test for inheritedness of lexical items. For instance, there is a strong tendency for articulation-type harmony of homorganic consonants at the beginning of syllables in (disyllabic) lexemes. Furthermore, it is very likely that PM lexemes with final *-im or *-ip sequences did not occur. This would explain the metathesis in *hidup (< PMP *quDip) which was suggested as a criterion for subgrouping Malayic isolects with some other languages (Blust 1981:463).\nOn the morphological level it appears that (besides the single transitive suffix *-i) PM probably had a subjunctive marker *-a. A patient-oriented prefix ancestral to di- in each of the isolects did not occur.",

Nasalisation of actor-oriented verbs, affixation of the nominalising affixes paN- and paNan, yield the following alternations:\n\n(1) velar nasal accretion for initial vowels, e.g.\n\n(adil): (ikat): (ukur):\n\nŋadili ‘give judgement’, paŋadilan ‘law court’ rpkat‘bind’, pəŋikat‘s.th. to bind’ ŋukur‘measure’, pəŋukur‘measurer, gauger’\n\n(2) homorganic nasal substitution for initial stops, e.g.\n\n(potfi(h)): (pikul): (bali): (buka7): (dagax): (dapat): (timbo): (tufijiP7): (cukur): (jaliŋ): (jait): (kapur) (in (kildr): (gundal): (gantuŋ):\n\nHelfrich\n\nkapux):\n\nmotp(h) ‘make white’ pamikul ‘s.o. carrying a yoke’ mali ‘buy’ pəmuka 7 ‘entrepreneur’ nayax ‘hear’ pənapat ‘opinion’ nimbo ‘bale (water)’ pənunju37 ‘pointer’ nukiir ‘shave’, pafiukur ‘barber’ nəliŋ ‘look sidelong, squint’ panait ‘dressmaker, n*eedle ŋapur ‘whitewash’ pərpjdr‘a file’ ŋundali ‘throw at (s.th.)’ pəŋantuŋan ‘place to hang s.th.’\n\nN.B. As the above examples show, in Aliana et al. stops become homorganic nasals. Helfrich, however, is vague about the exact nature of nasalisation of stops, but from his examples it appears that voiceless stops usually become homorganic nasals, and that voiced stops usually have homorganic nasal accretion. Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.",

Each C can be 0, and intervocalic C\ncan also be a cluster (see below). Monosyllables, trisyllables and tetrasyllables also occur. Constraints on the distribution of vowels:\n(1) Schwa does not occur in final syllables. (2) Initial schwa is always followed by a nasal or, in one case, a liquid (cf. əlaŋ, lag ‘kite (bird)’). There are two exceptions, both of which are SKT loanwords, viz. ərti ‘meaning’, ərto ‘goods’. (3) As a rule trisyllabic bases have an antepenultimate schwa. (4) Diphthongs only occur in the last syllable of a lexeme: -ay and -awonly occur lexeme finally (as in bagkay ‘corpse’ and pulaw ‘island’); i9 and uə only occur before final? and before Helfrich's final h (which does not occur in Aliana et al., see 2.4.1), e.g. kəei97 ‘small’, flu®? ‘beautiful’, bərsfi(h) ‘clean’, jaifi(h) ‘far’. (5) There are two mid-vowels, one of which, e, does not occur in Helfrich (2.4.1); odoes occur in Helfrich, but not in final closed syllables.",

Table 9 also shows that h between like vowels occurs in SM, MIN, BH, and JKT (in JKT a corresponding -?- is sometimes found, which is not in phonemic contrast with h, cf. 2.6). In SM, MIN, and JKT, however, two like vowels never occur adjacently, whereas in BH, they do. In this environment SM, MIN, and JKT h does not necessarily reflect a proto-phoneme, and its presence may be motivated by a phonotactic constraint. Finally, it appears that initially and intervocalically between unlike vowels, A only appears in SM and BH; in SM it is, moreover, almost always lost or optional in these environments, even when retained in the spelling. Since\n\n(1) the occurrence of BH h between like vowels is not conditioned by a phonotactic constraint (see also 3.10),\n(2) BH h in all positions is a stable phoneme which as a rule (and contrary to SM) never alternates with 0, and finally,\n(3) BH h reflects PMP *g, whereas BH 0 between like vowels does not (see 3.10),",

In a few cases -an(l) occurs in combination with bə(r)-. It does so with VDIs, VSIs, and precategorials, and it yields reciprocal verbs with a stative meaning, bə(r)- -an(V) forms are often in free variation with bə(r)- forms and -an(l) forms, e.g.\n\nbəjubəl ‘crowd (v)’ bərgaul ‘associate (v)’ kənal ‘know, be acquainted with’ dəkət ‘close’ laðn ‘other’\n\nbəjubəlan ‘id.’ (Muhadjir 1981:49-50) bərgaulan ‘id.’ (Muhadjir 1981:49-50) bəkənalan,kənalan ‘get to know each other’ bədəkətan ‘be near (to each other)’ bəlaðnan ‘be different (from each other)’\n\n(One of Muhadjir's examples is actually derived from a noun: (bə)paearan, ‘be in love with each other’ is derived from pacar ‘girl- or boy-friend’.)\n\n-an(2) is suffixed to VSIs, VDIs, and VTRs.

In this example the comparative marker labiah, ‘more’, on pendek, ‘short’, is missing but the interpretation shorter is still available. The comparative reading relies on the presence of the prepositional phrase dari pisau tu.\n\n(80)\n\nPisau ko\n\npendek dari pisau tu.\n\nknife DEM:prox short\n\nfrom knife DEM:dist\n\n‘This knife is shorter than that one.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n89\n\n\fNon-gradable states do no co-occur with comparative markers because they represent inherent polar states. Example (81) illustrates the use of the non-gradable stative predicate mati, ‘dead’. Stative predicates, like all predicate constructions, can be modified by preceding TAM adverbials. In (81) the TAM adverbial alah is used to mark perfective aspect. It is inserted before the stative predicate mati, but after the undergoer, maliang tu, ‘the thief’.\n\n(81)\n\nMaliang tu\n\nalah mati.\n\nthief\n\nDEM:dist PFCT dead\n\n‘The thief died.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAnother feature of stative predicates is that they productively derive active transitive verbs with the addition of active voice morphology and the applicative -an. Most active transitive verbs derived from statives this way will have a causative meaning. In (82) the active transitive verb mandinginan, ‘to cause to be cold’, has been derived by adding the active voice prefix maN- and the applicative -an to the stative root dingin.\n\n(82)\n\nAmbo mandinginan gulai.\n\n1sg AV-cold-APP curry\n\n‘I’m cooling down the curry.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

This then allows for a distinction to be made between stative verbs, which are not gradable, and a special class of property words that are gradable (Steinhauer, 2008). In fact, property words crosslinguistically are comparative, i.e. gradable (Anderson, 1985; Croft, 1991; Dixon, 1982; Schachter, 1985), which stative verbs are not. In Minangkabau, property words are gradable too, as example (50) shows; the comparative prefix sa- on gadang, ‘big’, shows that gadang is gradable. According to Langacker’s (1987b) terminology, this\n9 Rumah Gadang translates literally as ‘big house’ but the term is actually used to refer to the distinctive Minangkabau traditional houses with pointed curved rooves intended to signify the horns of a water buffalo.\n72\n\n\fmeans that gadang is relational and therefore notionally an adjective. However, as we established in Section 4.1.2.1, stative verbs can also be construed as relational since their meaning is framed against a polar opposite.\n\n(50)\n\nBulek-bulek sagadang talua puyuah.\n\nRED-round COMP-big egg quail\n\n‘It is round and as big as a quail’s egg.’\n\n(Text ID: 217881132319230306)",

Stative clauses with inherent physical state predicates have the same clause structure as emotional states but do not have the same special syntactic valence that allows for a second argument to be introduced into the clause. An example of a gradable stative predicate can be found in (78). The clause structure resembles the clause structure of a typical state as the undergoer pivot (the pronoun nyo) precedes the predicate tinggi, ‘tall’.\n\n(78)\n\nYo iko,\n\nnyo tinggi a.\n\nyes DEM:prox 3 tall FILL\n\n‘Yes this, its big eh.’\n\n(Text ID: 435063103250150406)\n\nGradable stative predicates can also be modified by comparative markers. In (79) the stative predicate tinggi is modified by the comparative labiah, ‘more’. Comparatives are inserted before the predicate and after any tense or aspect adverbials. Comparatives cannot be used with attributive nominal predicates like those exemplified in (58).\n\n(79)\n\nAnak tu\n\nalah labiah tinggi dari udanyo.\n\nchild DEM:dist PFCT more tall from older.brother-3\n\n‘That kid is already taller than his older brother.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

The origin of BH nag is also uncertain.\nSWY no is probably a secondary development of the third person possessive pronoun.

It should, however, be pointed out that MIN a could also be a contraction of an earlier +aha. This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2).

This meant that their answer would then provide contrastive focus between the two possible answers. In (113b) the answer Udin is given, but this answer should be understood in context; i.e. it was Udin that bought the new car (rather than somebody else). Since the answer Udin provides contrastive focus, this means that Udin the NP is referentially salient and therefore selected as the pivot. This in turn triggers active voice marking on the verb since Udin is an actor. Notice that although (113c) is grammatically well formed, in this context it is infelicitous (as shown by the # symbol).

Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT).

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

However, the pervasive use of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau have meant that the properties that make the P2 construction distinct in Standard Minangkabau do not apply in Colloquial Minangkabau. In fact, the evidence suggests that the P2 construction has merged with the bare active construction in the Colloquial variety.\n\nAs described in Section 5.1.4, the P2 construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau has a restrictive set of word order constraints. In Standard Minangkabau, nothing must intervene between the actor and the verb in a P2 clause, therefore all auxiliaries (i.e. negators and TAM adverbials) must precede the actor, whereas in a Standard Minangkabau active sentence, auxiliaries can intervene between the actor and the verb. In fact, if these clausal components occurred before the actor NP, then the sentence’s acceptability would be very much reduced. We do not find these word order constraints in Colloquial Minangkabau and in fact find that clauses with bare verbs allow both ‘auxiliary + actor’ and ‘actor + auxiliary’ word orders.\n\nFor example, consider the sentences in (266) which show that there are no constraints on the ordering of the actor NP and the auxiliary components in an active clause.\n\n(266) a. b. c.\n\nInyo acok ubah gayanyo.\n3 often change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo ubah gayanyo.\noften 3 change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\nAcok inyo maubah gayanyo.\noften 3 AV-change style-3\n‘He often changes his style.’\n(Elicitation)\n\n199",

In the Malay/Indonesian P2 construction, the verb is not marked for voice and the actor-verb word order of an active sentence is retained. However, the undergoer occurs in pre-verbal position and is assigned pivot status (Chung, 1976a). In the Malay/Indonesian di- passive construction, the actor is clearly demoted to non-core argument status, whereas the actor in a P2 clause remains a core argument of the verb (Arka and Manning, 2008; Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006). A further distinguishing feature of the P2 construction is that no auxiliaries (i.e. negators and TAM adverbials) may intervene between the actor and the verb (Sneddon, 1996: 249) (see Section 2.2).\n145",

Firstly, paN- and its correspondences do not refer to the location where the action or event takes place. An exception to this is IBN paN- which, as the only nominalising affix in IBN, has generalised its meaning in a maximal way. Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT). Fourthly, the syntactical role of SM paN- and MIN paN- is quite different from the (more restricted) role of their correspondences in other isolects.

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

Generally speaking, paN- and par- and their correspondences both refer to the actor of a performance, to the instrument with which the action is performed, or, with VSIs, to someone or something having the quality of (VSI) as a characteristic.

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb. In (51c) the prefixation of the active voice marker maN- creates a change of state verb from the root word and in (51d) the addition of the applicative –an derives a transitive, causative verb.\n\n(51) a.\n\nBaju itame tu\n\nnan gaek-gaek tu.\n\nshirt black-3 DEM:dist REL RED-old DEM:dist\n\n‘The old people wear black shirts.’\n\n(Text ID: 445038115055260406)\n73",

This then allows for a distinction to be made between stative verbs, which are not gradable, and a special class of property words that are gradable (Steinhauer, 2008). In fact, property words crosslinguistically are comparative, i.e. gradable (Anderson, 1985; Croft, 1991; Dixon, 1982; Schachter, 1985), which stative verbs are not. In Minangkabau, property words are gradable too, as example (50) shows; the comparative prefix sa- on gadang, ‘big’, shows that gadang is gradable. According to Langacker’s (1987b) terminology, this\n9 Rumah Gadang translates literally as ‘big house’ but the term is actually used to refer to the distinctive Minangkabau traditional houses with pointed curved rooves intended to signify the horns of a water buffalo.\n72\n\n\fmeans that gadang is relational and therefore notionally an adjective. However, as we established in Section 4.1.2.1, stative verbs can also be construed as relational since their meaning is framed against a polar opposite.\n\n(50)\n\nBulek-bulek sagadang talua puyuah.\n\nRED-round COMP-big egg quail\n\n‘It is round and as big as a quail’s egg.’\n\n(Text ID: 217881132319230306)",

As to its function of forming comparatives with VSIs in MIN and of forming excessives with VSIs in BH, this is an even smaller base for a PM reconstruction than in the case of tor- etc. with VSIs (cf. 6.2.2). Since kə- -an(V) and ter- etc. are to a great extent similar in function and meaning, a difference in distribution would be expected between them. However, I have not been able to discover any such difference that would hold for all isolects.\nAll isolects except IBN have a correspondence Of SM kə- -an(2) occurring with VSIs and forming nouns referring to the quality denoted by (VSI).

The clause structure resembles the clause structure of a typical state as the undergoer pivot (the pronoun nyo) precedes the predicate tinggi, ‘tall’.\n\n(78)\n\nYo iko,\n\nnyo tinggi a.\n\nyes DEM:prox 3 tall FILL\n\n‘Yes this, its big eh.’\n\n(Text ID: 435063103250150406)\n\nGradable stative predicates can also be modified by comparative markers. In (79) the stative predicate tinggi is modified by the comparative labiah, ‘more’. Comparatives are inserted before the predicate and after any tense or aspect adverbials. Comparatives cannot be used with attributive nominal predicates like those exemplified in (58).\n\n(79)\n\nAnak tu\n\nalah labiah tinggi dari udanyo.\n\nchild DEM:dist PFCT more tall from older.brother-3\n\n‘That kid is already taller than his older brother.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb. In (51c) the prefixation of the active voice marker maN- creates a change of state verb from the root word and in (51d) the addition of the applicative –an derives a transitive, causative verb.\n\n(51) a.\n\nBaju itame tu\n\nnan gaek-gaek tu.\n\nshirt black-3 DEM:dist REL RED-old DEM:dist\n\n‘The old people wear black shirts.’\n\n(Text ID: 445038115055260406)\n73",

This then allows for a distinction to be made between stative verbs, which are not gradable, and a special class of property words that are gradable (Steinhauer, 2008). In fact, property words crosslinguistically are comparative, i.e. gradable (Anderson, 1985; Croft, 1991; Dixon, 1982; Schachter, 1985), which stative verbs are not. In Minangkabau, property words are gradable too, as example (50) shows; the comparative prefix sa- on gadang, ‘big’, shows that gadang is gradable. According to Langacker’s (1987b) terminology, this\n9 Rumah Gadang translates literally as ‘big house’ but the term is actually used to refer to the distinctive Minangkabau traditional houses with pointed curved rooves intended to signify the horns of a water buffalo.\n72\n\n\fmeans that gadang is relational and therefore notionally an adjective. However, as we established in Section 4.1.2.1, stative verbs can also be construed as relational since their meaning is framed against a polar opposite.\n\n(50)\n\nBulek-bulek sagadang talua puyuah.\n\nRED-round COMP-big egg quail\n\n‘It is round and as big as a quail’s egg.’\n\n(Text ID: 217881132319230306)",

In this example the comparative marker labiah, ‘more’, on pendek, ‘short’, is missing but the interpretation shorter is still available. The comparative reading relies on the presence of the prepositional phrase dari pisau tu.\n\n(80)\n\nPisau ko\n\npendek dari pisau tu.\n\nknife DEM:prox short\n\nfrom knife DEM:dist\n\n‘This knife is shorter than that one.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n89\n\n\fNon-gradable states do no co-occur with comparative markers because they represent inherent polar states. Example (81) illustrates the use of the non-gradable stative predicate mati, ‘dead’. Stative predicates, like all predicate constructions, can be modified by preceding TAM adverbials. In (81) the TAM adverbial alah is used to mark perfective aspect. It is inserted before the stative predicate mati, but after the undergoer, maliang tu, ‘the thief’.\n\n(81)\n\nMaliang tu\n\nalah mati.\n\nthief\n\nDEM:dist PFCT dead\n\n‘The thief died.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAnother feature of stative predicates is that they productively derive active transitive verbs with the addition of active voice morphology and the applicative -an. Most active transitive verbs derived from statives this way will have a causative meaning. In (82) the active transitive verb mandinginan, ‘to cause to be cold’, has been derived by adding the active voice prefix maN- and the applicative -an to the stative root dingin.\n\n(82)\n\nAmbo mandinginan gulai.\n\n1sg AV-cold-APP curry\n\n‘I’m cooling down the curry.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice.

Jacobson, 1979; Swadesh, 1939), Salishan languages (cf. Jelinek and Demers, 1994; Kinkade, 1983; Kuipers, 1968) and Polynesian languages (cf. Broschart, 1997; Mosel and Hovdhaugen, 1992) are said to lack a noun-verb distinction; therefore it cannot be said that the primitive features [±noun] and [±verb] are underlying in these languages. Similarly in Minangkabau both nouns and verbs can function as predicates, a function typically assumed to be ‘verbal’ in nature. There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52",

                "content": "Foley (1998: 30) proposes that if roots do not entail argument structure, then they specify “some generalized conceptual structure” in the lexicon instead. For example, he suggests that a root like bigay, ‘give’, will specify the conceptual paradigm ‘giving by X of Y to Z’, but will not specify how X, Y and Z’s semantic roles map onto argument structure. The role of voice morphology is then to specify how the semantic roles specified by the root’s conceptual structure ought to be realised syntactically. To do this, the root must first become a verb. So, according to Foley, voice morphology actually performs a single derivational process: deriving a verb from a precategorial root and selecting a specific semantic role as the pivot.\nSince argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, according to Foley (1998; 2008) this means that there is no preference as to which of the participants entailed by the root’s conceptual structure gets realised as the pivot. This, he argues, shows that no one voice type is basic and that voice in Philippine-type languages is ‘symmetrical’ (see Section 2.1). Naturally, precategoriality and symmetrical voice systems are complementary features and it is these features, he argues, that are typologically salient in Philippine-type languages.\nNevertheless, whether Philippine-type languages are precategorial or not is still a matter of debate and a number of alternate analyses have been put forward. Two of these alternate analyses are discussed here. First, we will examine Kroeger’s (1998) argument against precategoriality, and second, we will discuss Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) proposal that the morphology of Philippine-type languages is multifunctional.",

Perhaps bare verb constructions don’t represent some kind of defective or underspecified version of a voice marked verb construction. Instead, they are used in cases where voice and semantic roles are not just underspecified, but unimportant. This is because ambiguity is a perfectly acceptable feature of Colloquial Minangkabau discourse. Gil (2002a; 2006) explores similar ideas\n211",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

We saw in Section 6.1.3 that Minangkabau parts of speech are multifunctional; nouns prototypically function to refer but can also function to predicate and modify; and verbs prototypically function to predicate but can also function to refer and modify. Verbal functions are usually indicated by the presence of verbal morphology, however Section 6.2.1 demonstrated that voice marking on the verb is not obligatory. Therefore we have a set of roots in Minangkabau that can appear in a range of construction types (referential, modificatory, predicative) but that are not differentiated at the morphological level.

This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

First, the characterisation of voice relies heavily on the nature of grammatical relations in the language. Second, in addition to the syntactic processes that motivate voice, it is also essential to consider the motivating discourse/pragmatic factors involved. Third, as well as encoding syntactic distinctions, voice marking may also encode semantic and conceptual distinctions such as aspectual notions. This third issue is especially important to consider for pivotless languages like Acehnese, since ‘voice’ marking does not encode grammatical relations in this kind of language. These theoretical themes also heavily inform my characterisation of the syntactic, discourse/pragmatic, and semantic properties of voice in Minangkabau (see Chapter 5).\n40\n\n\f41",

This raised questions not only about the obligatoriness of voice marking but also how speakers are able to determine the semantic roles of the participants in the clause. Conducting elicitation was an essential stage in the process of understanding these bare verb forms because I was able to ask speakers about the restrictions on using these bare forms and also to test the productivity and use of these forms in syntactic and pragmatic contexts not found in the corpus.\n5 An Aqiqa is a Muslim ceremony in which a new born baby is named. 45",

The other participants in the clause are marked by articles that show their semantic role; for example the benefactor bata, ‘child’, is marked by the benefactive composite para sa and so on.\nSentences (5b), (5c) and (5d) show the three other Tagalog voice types. In (5b) the verb is marked for goal voice, meaning that the goal bigas, ‘rice’, is the pivot. In (5c) the direction is the pivot therefore the verb is marked for locative voice, and in (5d) the benefactor is pivot therefore the verb is marked for benefactive voice.\nAn additional typologically salient feature of Philippine-type voice systems is that they are symmetrical (Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2005; 2008). This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6). Thus, voice marking in Philippine-type languages also has a verbal derivational function.\n2.2 Indonesian-type Voice",

Perhaps bare verb constructions don’t represent some kind of defective or underspecified version of a voice marked verb construction. Instead, they are used in cases where voice and semantic roles are not just underspecified, but unimportant. This is because ambiguity is a perfectly acceptable feature of Colloquial Minangkabau discourse. Gil (2002a; 2006) explores similar ideas\n211",

However, unlike Philippine-type languages, which allow for a range of participant types to be assigned pivot status, in Indonesiantype languages voice alternation centres around the alignment of the pivot function with either the actor or the undergoer (cf. Klamer, 1996). If the actor is selected as the pivot then the verb is marked for active voice, however if the undergoer is selected as the pivot then the verb is marked for passive voice.\n21",

Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice. The sentences in (21) show two Riau Indonesian ‘neutral’ constructions in which the verb beli, ‘buy’, is unmarked.\n\n(21) a.\n\nBeli aku laser, kan.\nbuy 1sg laser Q\n‘I’ll buy a laser, right.’ [Context: Contemplating a shopping trip.]\n\n38\n\n\fb.

In (21a) notice that the verb is followed by the actor, the first person pronoun aku, and then the patient, laser, ‘ a laser’.

Section 5.1.1 explains the role of discourse pragmatics in selecting the pivot in Minangkabau, examines the Minangkabau pivot function in the context of semantic roles and grammatical relations, and also demonstrates how to identify a pivot in Minangkabau by showing the range of syntactic structures over which it has control. Sections 5.1.2, 5.1.3, and 5.1.4 then describe active voice, passive voice and the pasif semu (P2) constructions respectively, and show how these voice constructions interact with the pivot, how they alter grammatical relations, and how they also operate within the semantic and lexical/derivational domains.\n5.1.1 The Pivot Function\n5.1.1.1 Pivots and Discourse Pragmatics\nIn Minangkabau, there are a number of discourse pragmatic factors that affect voice marking.

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

                "content": "Foley (1998: 30) proposes that if roots do not entail argument structure, then they specify “some generalized conceptual structure” in the lexicon instead. For example, he suggests that a root like bigay, ‘give’, will specify the conceptual paradigm ‘giving by X of Y to Z’, but will not specify how X, Y and Z’s semantic roles map onto argument structure. The role of voice morphology is then to specify how the semantic roles specified by the root’s conceptual structure ought to be realised syntactically. To do this, the root must first become a verb. So, according to Foley, voice morphology actually performs a single derivational process: deriving a verb from a precategorial root and selecting a specific semantic role as the pivot.\nSince argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, according to Foley (1998; 2008) this means that there is no preference as to which of the participants entailed by the root’s conceptual structure gets realised as the pivot. This, he argues, shows that no one voice type is basic and that voice in Philippine-type languages is ‘symmetrical’ (see Section 2.1). Naturally, precategoriality and symmetrical voice systems are complementary features and it is these features, he argues, that are typologically salient in Philippine-type languages.\nNevertheless, whether Philippine-type languages are precategorial or not is still a matter of debate and a number of alternate analyses have been put forward. Two of these alternate analyses are discussed here. First, we will examine Kroeger’s (1998) argument against precategoriality, and second, we will discuss Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) proposal that the morphology of Philippine-type languages is multifunctional.",

First, the characterisation of voice relies heavily on the nature of grammatical relations in the language. Second, in addition to the syntactic processes that motivate voice, it is also essential to consider the motivating discourse/pragmatic factors involved. Third, as well as encoding syntactic distinctions, voice marking may also encode semantic and conceptual distinctions such as aspectual notions. This third issue is especially important to consider for pivotless languages like Acehnese, since ‘voice’ marking does not encode grammatical relations in this kind of language. These theoretical themes also heavily inform my characterisation of the syntactic, discourse/pragmatic, and semantic properties of voice in Minangkabau (see Chapter 5).\n40\n\n\f41",

First, there are no clear nominalising processes in Philippine-type languages. All affixes that are used to derive nominal forms can also be used as voice marking affixes, therefore there are no unique nominalising affixes. In addition to this, inflected verb forms can also function as NP heads without any change to their morphological marking. Second, Foley argues that roots do not have an underlying argument structure. If this is the case then this means there is nothing at the lexical level to differentiate verbs from nouns.\n213",

This means that each voice affix has a bundle of syntactic and semantic features, only some of which are profiled in a given instance. However, the correlations between the specific syntactic and semantic sense of the affix being used and the ontological type of the root undergoing derivation is difficult to clarify. For example, in Tagalog the prefix ma- can occur with a large majority of all content words and can mean either ‘to have ROOT’ or ‘to become ROOT’ yet there is no clear and consistent patterning of nominal or verbal roots with either of these meanings (Himmelmann, 2008: 16-17).\nNeither Foley’s (1998; 2008), nor Kroeger’s (1998), nor Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) proposals can directly explain the categoriality status of the Minangkabau bare verb forms since their analyses are made to account for the peculiarities of Philippine-type languages. Nevertheless, these analyses point to three main factors for consideration before making assessments about the categorical status of roots in Minangkabau: whether the argument structure of verbs is specified in the lexicon, whether there are unique nominalisation or verbalisation processes in the language, and whether the multifunctionality of morphology patterns with specific lexical categories. I will now discuss each of these factors in turn.\n6.3.1.1 Argument Structure",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

In the Malay/Indonesian P2 construction, the verb is not marked for voice and the actor-verb word order of an active sentence is retained. However, the undergoer occurs in pre-verbal position and is assigned pivot status (Chung, 1976a). In the Malay/Indonesian di- passive construction, the actor is clearly demoted to non-core argument status, whereas the actor in a P2 clause remains a core argument of the verb (Arka and Manning, 2008; Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006). A further distinguishing feature of the P2 construction is that no auxiliaries (i.e. negators and TAM adverbials) may intervene between the actor and the verb (Sneddon, 1996: 249) (see Section 2.2).\n145",

Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”",

Perhaps bare verb constructions don’t represent some kind of defective or underspecified version of a voice marked verb construction. Instead, they are used in cases where voice and semantic roles are not just underspecified, but unimportant.

One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT.

Since voice in Minangkabau is the focus of Chapter 5, discussion of these relational properties can be found in Chapter 5 instead.\n\nFirst, let us examine the adverbial notions associated with verbs in Minangkabau. As Table 10 shows, negation, but not evidentiality, is a grammatical category in Minangkabau.\n68\n\n\fIn Indonesian, verbal and nominal predicates can be distinguished by the choice of negator.

An example of this can be seen in (44), where the prohibitive particle jan negates the verb masak, ‘cook’. Jan cannot be used with NPs as example (45a) shows. To use a prohibitive construction with an NP, the verb jadi, ‘become, happen’, must be used, as shown in example (45b).\n69\n\n\f(44)\n\nJan masak nasi kini, beko se.\n\nPROHIB cook rice now later just\n\n‘Don't cook the rice now, just do it later.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n(45) a.\n\n*Jan guru.\nPROHIB teacher\n‘Don’t be a teacher.’\n\nb.

In Minangkabau TAM distinctions are not morphologically marked on the verb. Instead the verb is modified by preceding adverbial TAM markers (see Table 14).\n\nThree TAM adverbials, nio, alah and alun, are exemplified in examples (46), (47) and (48) respectively.

For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

Ambo maagiahan inyo pitih.\n1sg AV-give-APP 3 money\n‘I gave that guy money.’ (Elicitation)\nAnother feature of ditransitive verbs is that the recipient argument can be assigned core argument status and swap places with the undergoer argument. For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice.

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

An exception to this is IBN paN- which, as the only nominalising affix in IBN, has generalised its meaning in a maximal way. Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT). Fourthly, the syntactical role of SM paN- and MIN paN- is quite different from the (more restricted) role of their correspondences in other isolects.

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

The applicative -an licenses benefactors for transitive verbs whose semantics prevent a dative-like ‘giving’ reading. For example, in (236) the applicative -an combines with the transitive verb root masak, ‘cook’, to create the benefactive verb mamasakan, ‘cook for someone’. The applicative licenses a benefactive participant and not a recipient participant due to the semantics of the verb root masak.

Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

The verb gigik, ‘bite’, in (154) is transitive and therefore specifies an undergoer argument but in this example the undergoer argument is omitted and the verb is not marked for active voice. This means that “the semantic transitivity of the verb root is not represented” thus causing the clause to be ungrammatical (Fortin, 2001: 14). Although Fortin’s claims may represent the judgments of many Minangkabau speakers, the conversational data in the MPI EVA Minangkabau database reveals a different picture.

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one.

Clauses containing meN- verbs on the other hand were imperfective, often irrealis and frequently found in backgrounded clauses.\nSimilarly, a recent study of contemporary Malay meN-, also found that the prefix was associated with imperfective and progressive aspect (Soh and Nomoto, 2008). Furthermore, in her study of Chindo, a variety of Non-Standard Indonesian spoken by the Peranakan Chinese community in Malang, East Java, Rafferty (1982) argues that the homorganic nasal prefix N-, traditionally thought of as encoding active voice, functions primarily as a marker of imperfective aspect. The passive voice marker di- conversely has the function of marking perfective aspect in this variety (see Section 2.2).\nNone of these studies claims that meN- or N- encodes imperfective aspect but it is clear that the use of the active voice prefix correlates closely with clauses that display these imperfective aspectual qualities. The fact that Minangkabau maN- has similar aspectual qualities is a result of its role in showing the development of action.\n5.1.3 Passive Voice\nTo complete our understanding of Minangkabau’s pragmatically motivated voice system now let us discuss the phonological, syntactic and semantic effects of the passive voice marker di-.\n5.1.3.1 Phonological Properties of di-\nIn Minangkabau, passive voice is encoded by the morpheme di-.

Minangkabau marks active voice using the conservative form of the prefix maN-, whereas Standard Malay/Indonesian makes use of the cognate form meN-. Some more innovative Indonesian-type languages, such as non-standard varieties of Malay/Indonesian, have retained only the homorganic nasal part of the active voice prefix. A typical Indonesian-type active voice construction will not only have voice marking on the verb, but the actor will also occupy pre-verbal position and if the verb is transitive, the undergoer will follow the verb.\nIn most Indonesian-type languages passive voice is marked on the verb by an oral prefix (i.e. a prefix with an initial oral, as opposed to nasal, stop) or a pronominal cliticised form of the agent (Ross, 2002: 54-56). In some other Indonesian-type languages the passive voice verb is unmarked. In an Indonesian-type passive voice clause the undergoer typically occupies pre-verbal position because it is the pivot.

According to Hopper and Thompson, this suggests that the undergoer is highly individuated, which in turn also means that the clause is high in transitivity. Another feature of clauses high in transitivity is that they are associated with telic aspect due to the degree of affectedness of the undergoer. Thus di- clauses in Minangkabau can be given a telic reading not because aspectual marking is a direct property of di-, but because di- clauses are high in transitivity.\n5.1.4 The Pasif Semu\nIn Standard Minangkabau, there is another kind of passive voice construction called the pasif semu (henceforth the P2 construction). Like a di- passive, the undergoer in a P2 construction performs the pivot function. However, unlike a di- passive, the actor in a P2 construction retains its status as a core argument. The P2 verb is unmarked yet the construction remains distinctive from a bare active construction because of the word order constraints it exhibits. However, due to the high frequency of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau, the P2 is not a distinctive construction in this variety (see Section 3.3 and Section 6.1.2.4).",

Clauses containing meN- verbs on the other hand were imperfective, often irrealis and frequently found in backgrounded clauses.\nSimilarly, a recent study of contemporary Malay meN-, also found that the prefix was associated with imperfective and progressive aspect (Soh and Nomoto, 2008). Furthermore, in her study of Chindo, a variety of Non-Standard Indonesian spoken by the Peranakan Chinese community in Malang, East Java, Rafferty (1982) argues that the homorganic nasal prefix N-, traditionally thought of as encoding active voice, functions primarily as a marker of imperfective aspect. The passive voice marker di- conversely has the function of marking perfective aspect in this variety (see Section 2.2).\nNone of these studies claims that meN- or N- encodes imperfective aspect but it is clear that the use of the active voice prefix correlates closely with clauses that display these imperfective aspectual qualities. The fact that Minangkabau maN- has similar aspectual qualities is a result of its role in showing the development of action.\n5.1.3 Passive Voice\nTo complete our understanding of Minangkabau’s pragmatically motivated voice system now let us discuss the phonological, syntactic and semantic effects of the passive voice marker di-.\n5.1.3.1 Phonological Properties of di-\nIn Minangkabau, passive voice is encoded by the morpheme di-.

It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them.

The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’.

Furthermore, the pervasive use of bare verbs in Colloquial Minangkabau has meant that the P2 is not a distinctive construction (see Section 6.1.2.4).\nThe following sections will show some examples of bare verbs found in the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus and discuss some of the ways in which speakers are able to decode the ‘voice’ of the bare verb forms and assign semantic roles to the participants in the clause. Discourse-pragmatic and contextual factors play a significant role in determining this. The syntactic organisation of the clause also affects the interpretation of bare verbs as active or passive since passive voice clauses are highly syntactised.\n6.1.2.1 Bare Actives\nLike Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b), bare verbs are frequently used in place of verbs marked for active voice. Both transitive and intransitive bare active verbs were found in the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus, but intransitive verbs were found to be unmarked more frequently than transitives. Using the bare form of an active intransitive verb instead of the voice marked form is unambiguous because only one participant, the actor, is licensed by the verb. This means that assigning a semantic role to the participant is based on the inherent argument structure of the verb rather than syntactic or discourse-pragmatic factors.\nSome examples of bare active intransitive verbs follow in (249) and (250). In (249) the active intransitive verb lari, ‘run’, is not marked for voice yet the third person participant nyo is clearly an actor because this is the only participant role specified by the verb. Similarly in (250) the active intransitive verb tagak, ‘stand (up)’, is not marked for voice. The first person plural pronoun kami is assigned the actor role because it is the only role specified by the verb.\n187\n\n\f(249) (250)",

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-.

Foregrounded clauses are typically realis and are associated with perfective or telic aspect.\nHopper and Thompson (1980) also argue that passive clauses are associated with telic aspect. In passive clauses, the undergoer is conceptually salient and highly referential. According to Hopper and Thompson, this suggests that the undergoer is highly individuated, which in turn also means that the clause is high in transitivity. Another feature of clauses high in transitivity is that they are associated with telic aspect due to the degree of affectedness of the undergoer. Thus di- clauses in Minangkabau can be given a telic reading not because aspectual marking is a direct property of di-, but because di- clauses are high in transitivity.\n5.1.4 The Pasif Semu\nIn Standard Minangkabau, there is another kind of passive voice construction called the pasif semu (henceforth the P2 construction). Like a di- passive, the undergoer in a P2 construction performs the pivot function. However, unlike a di- passive, the actor in a P2 construction retains its status as a core argument. The P2 verb is unmarked yet the construction remains distinctive from a bare active construction because of the word order constraints it exhibits. However, due to the high frequency of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau, the P2 is not a distinctive construction in this variety (see Section 3.3 and Section 6.1.2.4).",

Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice. The sentences in (21) show two Riau Indonesian ‘neutral’ constructions in which the verb beli, ‘buy’, is unmarked.\n\n(21) a.\n\nBeli aku laser, kan.\nbuy 1sg laser Q\n‘I’ll buy a laser, right.’ [Context: Contemplating a shopping trip.]\n\n38\n\n\fb.

In (21a) notice that the verb is followed by the actor, the first person pronoun aku, and then the patient, laser, ‘ a laser’.

Semantic role assignment in this case is determined by word order. As we see in (187b), if we swap the positions of aden and inyo in the clause then this affects the assignment of semantic roles. As inyo precedes the verb in (187b) it becomes the actor. The first person pronoun aden then becomes the undergoer.\nExample (187c) is a P2 construction. Note that the actor precedes the verb and the undergoer inyo occupies clause initial position, which is the pivot slot in a P2 clause. Example (187d) provides further evidence that picayo can appear in a P2 construction as it displays the ‘auxiliary + actor’ word order distinctive of a P2 construction. Examples (187e) and (187f) provide further evidence that the construction in (187c) is a P2 construction since only the undergoer inyo can be raised.\nAlthough the P2 is a distinct construction in Standard Malay/Indonesian and in Standard Minangkabau, there is evidence to suggest that in some non-standard, regional, and contact varieties of Malay/Indonesian, such as Basilectal Jakarta Indonesian, Sarang Lan Malay, Mundung Darat Malay and Kuching Malay, the P2 construction has lost its distinctiveness (Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). The pervasive use of bare verbs in these varieties, coupled with flexible word order constraints, has meant that the P2 has merged with the bare active construction. Evidence suggests that the P2 has also merged with the bare active in Colloquial Minangkabau as well (see Chapter 6).\n5.2 Voice and the “Evolution of Action”",

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation.

The origin of BH nag is also uncertain.\nSWY no is probably a secondary development of the third person possessive pronoun. Finally, the origin of IBN ti and kə are obscure; ti must be a contracted form, since in MUA tay (written ‘tai’) is found.

It should, however, be pointed out that MIN a could also be a contraction of an earlier +aha. This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2).

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT. Solution (4) yields more perspectives, because it fits in with the fact that JKT -an(l) also seems to be borrowed. Furthermore, JKT has only two suffixes",

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-. Foregrounding clauses were also more likely to be perfective, and backgrounding clauses to be imperfective. He argues then that e- and Nare associated with this aspectual distinction not categorically, but by virtue of their appearance in foregrounding and backgrounding clauses respectively.\n\nExamples (11) and (12) come from a recounting of the folk tale Bang Mera so Bang Pote, ‘Onion and Garlic’, which tells of the fate of two sisters named Onion and Garlic. In (11) we see an example of active voice used in a clause containing background information. In (12) we see use of the “object voice” in a foreground clause used to describe an “action that moves the story forward” (Davies, 2005: 213).\n\n(11)\n\nReng lake’ gelle’ ngrabadi Bang.Pote.\n\nperson male previous AV-care-APP Garlic\n\n‘The man took care of Garlic.’\n\n(Davies, 2005: 213)\n\n(12)\n\nSamper gelle’ etabang bi’ Bang.Pote.\n\ncloth\n\nprevious OV-search with Garlic\n\n‘Garlic searched for the cloth.’\n\n(Davies, 2005: 213)",

Thus, for Shibatani, although active voice indicates a pragmatically motivated opposition to passive voice, it also has conceptual underpinnings. The Minangkabau active voice marker maN- also occupies this intersection between semantics and pragmatics and also functions to show the development of an action. In Colloquial Minangkabau the functional load of maN- is primarily semantic since it is not used to mark a pragmatic voice distinction (see Chapter 6).\n\nThere is also evidence to support an analysis of meN- in Malay/Indonesian as a semantic/conceptual device used to mark aspectual notions. Hopper’s (1979) work argues that the foregrounding and backgrounding of events in Classical Malay discourse is achieved through voice marking, whereas other languages achieve this through various other strategies including tense-aspect marking on the verb, word order, and\n131",

It was argued that this class of lexical/derivational devices function to show a conceptually motivated system of voice oppositions and that this voice system can be usefully described in terms of Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework. Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

                "content": "So do bare verbs mean the same as voice marked verbs? In Colloquial Minangkabau bare verbs are clearly underspecified in comparison to voice marked verbs. However, speakers are generally able to assign semantic roles to participants in a clause with a bare verb, which suggests that the role of voice marking in Colloquial Minangkabau is not syntactic. In Standard Minangkabau, maN- has a clearly delineated semantic function (see Section 5.1.2.3) and di- has some associated semantic and aspectual properties as a result of its syntactic role in individuating the undergoer participant (see Section 5.1.3.3). So in Colloquial Minangkabau, the opposition between bare verbs, maN-, and di- must be primarily motivated by these semantic factors in a similar way to the opposition between the active and passive voice markers N- and di- in Riau Indonesian (see Section 2.4 and Section 6.3.2). In Colloquial Minangkabau, bare verbs\n210",

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation. Yet, as examples (263), (264) and (265) show, even in ambiguous cases voice marking is not required.",

The other participants in the clause are marked by articles that show their semantic role; for example the benefactor bata, ‘child’, is marked by the benefactive composite para sa and so on.\nSentences (5b), (5c) and (5d) show the three other Tagalog voice types. In (5b) the verb is marked for goal voice, meaning that the goal bigas, ‘rice’, is the pivot. In (5c) the direction is the pivot therefore the verb is marked for locative voice, and in (5d) the benefactor is pivot therefore the verb is marked for benefactive voice.\nAn additional typologically salient feature of Philippine-type voice systems is that they are symmetrical (Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2005; 2008). This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6). Thus, voice marking in Philippine-type languages also has a verbal derivational function.\n2.2 Indonesian-type Voice",

Gil (2000: 192) argues that similar constructions\n63\n\n\fin Malay, for example rumah Bobok, ‘Bobok’s house’ are in fact nominative attributive constructions. This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively.

Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT).

The resulting nouns were at least abstract nouns and nouns referring to the location where the action takes place. They may also have been nouns referring to the goal or instrument of the action (as such nouns are also found in some of the isolects). Whether the PM ancestral form had other applications is difficult to tell. BH paN-_-an forms also refer to actor. They are close in meaning to paN- forms, the only difference being that a notion of intensity occurs in the former. Here paN- -an is possibly analysable as a combination of paN- (cf. 6.7.1.3) and -an(l) (cf. 6.5.3); this may also be assumed for BH paN- -an on the basis of VSIs. These BH forms are on the other hand similar to JKT paN-an forms denoting ‘s.o. who / s.th. which often performs (VSI)’. However, the JKT forms occur with VSIs, whereas the BH forms do not .

In SM paN- occurs with VSIs, VDIs, and VTRs; forms with VSIs denote a characteristic. Forms on the basis of VDIs or VTRs usually denote an actor or instrument, but (particularly in Classical Malay) they also denote a goal or result, or they form an abstract noun. Furthermore paN- forms are used attributively, and, on the basis of VSIs, they can function as VSIs. In Classical Malay they may also occur following a preposition. Finally, when they have sə- prefixed they denote a measure of time or space, or a point in time (these forms are also more usual in Classical Malay).\nIn MIN, paN- occurs with VSIs, VDIs, and VTRs. The resulting nouns are used attributively and predicatively with the meaning ‘having the quality or habit of (base)’, and they may have a complement; they are also used as a noun denoting a habit, an instrument, or an actor.\nIn BH paN- forms nouns referring to the actor or instrument, or it forms abstract nouns, when prefixed to VDIs and VTRs, and it refers to someone having a characteristic or inclination when prefixed to VSIs.\nOnly a few examples are available of SWY paN- forms: they refer to actor or instrument, but in one case they form an abstract noun on the basis of a VSI (pənakit), and in another case a noun referring to the object of an act on the basis of a VTR (paganju3?).\nIn IBN paN- is the only nominaliser, and its meaning is quite general (including actor, object, instrument, place, and abstract noun).\nJKT paN- refers to the actor if the base is a VDI, it refers to the actor, object, instrument, or it forms an abstract noun, if the base is a VTR, and it refers to a person who has (VSI) as a characteristic if the base is a VSI.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

Minangkabau also has a class of ‘property words’, but since these property words are used to predicate I argue that they represent a sub-type of stative verb. As well as nouns and verbs I also argue that Minangkabau has a class of adverbs, which are discussed in Section 4.2.1.3. Nouns, verbs and adverbs are open class items, but Minangkabau also has a number of closed class items including pronouns, prepositions, specifiers, negators, TAM adverbials and pragmatic particles.

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes.

Cross-linguistically, applicatives function as transitivisers. For intransitive verb roots applicatives license an additional argument and for transitive roots they function to increase the transitivity of the verb, or to modify the verb’s argument structure. Applicatives also allow for non-core arguments such as prepositional, indirective, benefactive and instrumental participants, to be included as part of the verb’s core argument structure (Peterson, 2007: 2). Some applicatives also allow comitative and ‘reason’ participants to be raised to core argument status (Sirk, 1996). Furthermore, applicatives may have secondary semantic functions in addition to their valency changing functions, including deriving verbs from nominal sources and marking aspectual notions such as continuous, iterative and intense activity (Klamer, 2000).",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

SM bara/g (5.5.2.5) and SM ya/g (2.1.3, 3.3, 5.5.2.3). PM *g apparently developed from PMP *p, but its use became very restricted. Reflexes of PMP *g are found in a good many other Austronesian languages, where they often also occur in numeral compounds (between digits and higher order numerals). In some languages they are used as a linker between the constituents of almost any kind of noun phrase, as in Tagalog. That PM *g was not yet fossilised can be deduced from the fact that ya/g and bara/g cannot be reconstructed for PM (Adelaar in press b).\n\n6.2 SM tar- AND ITS CORRESPONDENCES\n\n6.2.1 SM",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

It was argued that this class of lexical/derivational devices function to show a conceptually motivated system of voice oppositions and that this voice system can be usefully described in terms of Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework. Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

Whether a group of consonants is realised as a cluster or acquires an epenthetic schwa depends among other things on the number of syllables in the lexeme. Disyllabism is favouredin the canonical shape of JKT lexemes, and the insertion of ə would often result in more than two syllables. Nevertheless, there are inherited JKT lexemes which always occur with an initial consonant cluster, and which can form a contrasting minimal pair with lexemes containing a schwa. They may have a sound-symbolic value, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a stop or s + a liquid. Sometimes they are the result either of extension of a monosyllabic lexeme, or of reduction ofanother (non-monosyllabic) lexeme, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a nasal + a homorganic stop. (Grijns 1981:19-28). In the word-structural interpretation underlying Abdul Chaer's dictionary, initial clusters of s + a liquid do not occur. 73This list of clusters is not exhaustive (Abdul Chaer 1976:passim).",

Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.",

Another possibility is that ‘e’ refers to a schwa, and to a mid-front vowel, but again, Abdul Jebar does not mention the occurrence of BK schwa in his phonological outline). A problem with the treatment of BH and BK lexicon is that Abdul Jebar does not distinguish between them consistently: some of his entries are marked with BH or BK, but most are not; one might suppose that unidentified lexemes belong to BK if they contain a mid-vowel, but even then one is left with many lexemes belonging either to BH, to BK, or to both.

As the above examples show, in Aliana et al. stops become homorganic nasals.

Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.",

Zorc considers IBN lexemes with a diphthongised last syllable to be evidence for the development of PAN *5, *H, and *i’to IBN -7, which is unwarranted since there is no way of telling whether earlier (undiphthongised) forms of these lexemes had -'’or not. The lexemes in question are: tuay, umay, kitay, tubay, bugay, and n/aday, better evidence for *kitaHis IBN kita7 ‘you (plural)’ (if this is not a SAR loan, cf. 3.2.3). Furthermore, IBN (and also Mualang) have a fossilised suffix -7, which marks transitivity (see 6.1.1). It is a reflex of the PAN locative focus marker, and it corresponds to -i in Philippine and Formosan languages (Wolff 1973:73, 77). It is not likely that the -7 in IBN -i7 reflects a PAN laryngeal, since no corresponding consonant is found in Formosan or Philippine languages. But more important criticism to Zorc's sound law is that there are too many unexplained IBN exceptions. To start with, his evidence for PAN *-S > IBN -7 is too weak.110065 There are only three cases out of nine that support this correspondence, viz. dga7, pari7 and tuma7. In two cases the IBN reflexes do not provide evidence viz. tuay and paah (-h unexplained), and four reflexes provide counterevidence: tabu, tali, dai, and kuku. Evidence for PAN *-H > IBN -7 is much stronger, although here too one is left with a considerable number of exceptions. Out of 17 examples, 11 (including kita7 ‘you (plural)’) exemplify the change, viz. bara7, baru7, daki7, iu7, jawa7, jarami7, kita7, lima7, tai7, tapa7, and tau7; two do not provide evidence because of the diphthongisation of the last syllable (kitay not included), viz.\n105See fn. 102. 106Seefn. 102.",

Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice.

Nasalisation of actor-oriented verbs, affixation of the nominalising affixes paN- and paNan, yield the following alternations:\n\n(1) velar nasal accretion for initial vowels, e.g.\n\n(adil): (ikat): (ukur):\n\nŋadili ‘give judgement’, paŋadilan ‘law court’ rpkat‘bind’, pəŋikat‘s.th. to bind’ ŋukur‘measure’, pəŋukur‘measurer, gauger’\n\n(2) homorganic nasal substitution for initial stops, e.g.\n\n(potfi(h)): (pikul): (bali): (buka7): (dagax): (dapat): (timbo): (tufijiP7): (cukur): (jaliŋ): (jait): (kapur) (in (kildr): (gundal): (gantuŋ):\n\nHelfrich\n\nkapux):\n\nmotp(h) ‘make white’ pamikul ‘s.o. carrying a yoke’ mali ‘buy’ pəmuka 7 ‘entrepreneur’ nayax ‘hear’ pənapat ‘opinion’ nimbo ‘bale (water)’ pənunju37 ‘pointer’ nukiir ‘shave’, pafiukur ‘barber’ nəliŋ ‘look sidelong, squint’ panait ‘dressmaker, n*eedle ŋapur ‘whitewash’ pərpjdr‘a file’ ŋundali ‘throw at (s.th.)’ pəŋantuŋan ‘place to hang s.th.’\n\nN.B. As the above examples show, in Aliana et al. stops become homorganic nasals. Helfrich, however, is vague about the exact nature of nasalisation of stops, but from his examples it appears that voiceless stops usually become homorganic nasals, and that voiced stops usually have homorganic nasal accretion. Apparent exceptions are (baix), mbaix, maix ‘pay’, (ball), mbali, məli ‘buy’, (with nasal accretion as well as nasal substitution), (daqax), nagax ‘hear’ (Helfrich specifies that (daqax) is the only lexeme with initial d undergoing nasal substitution), (pampo), (mə)mpampo ‘carry on both hands’.",

It sometimes alternates with 7 as in puhun,pu?un ‘tree’.\n72Grijns says that most bases with an initial cluster have a variant form with an epenthetic schwa between the consonants. Whether a group of consonants is realised as a cluster or acquires an epenthetic schwa depends among other things on the number of syllables in the lexeme. Disyllabism is favouredin the canonical shape of JKT lexemes, and the insertion of ə would often result in more than two syllables. Nevertheless, there are inherited JKT lexemes which always occur with an initial consonant cluster, and which can form a contrasting minimal pair with lexemes containing a schwa. They may have a sound-symbolic value, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a stop or s + a liquid. Sometimes they are the result either of extension of a monosyllabic lexeme, or of reduction ofanother (non-monosyllabic) lexeme, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a nasal + a homorganic stop. (Grijns 1981:19-28). In the word-structural interpretation underlying Abdul Chaer's dictionary, initial clusters of s + a liquid do not occur. 73This list of clusters is not exhaustive (Abdul Chaer 1976:passim).",

This compound form has replaced PMP *siwa, and is sometimes circumscribed in SM as kurag əsa or kurag satu ‘minus one’; such a circumscription is also used in larger numbers with ‘nine’ as the last component, e.g. sə-ratus kuraŋ əsa or sə-ratus kurag satu ‘ninety-nine’, and kurag əsa əmpat puluh ‘thirty-nine’ (Gerth van Wijk p.205). BH saga is a JV loan (see ‘8’ above), and in IBN s/əmil/an the original *-mb- was weakened to -m- (3.11A). BAC has s/alap/ag ‘nine’, hence *(a)sa 7alap-an next to *(a)sa 7ambil-an.\n‘11’ - ‘19’ - All isolects exhibit bəlas etc. for the formation of numbers between ten and twenty. Nevertheless I reconstruct *sA-puluh with a following cardinal number for PM numerals between ten and twenty, on account of OM, BRU and BAC. In OM ‘twelve’ occurs in the following line of the Kedukan Bukit inscription (Palembang):\ndagan jalan saribu tluratus sapulu dua vanak-na with infantry 1,000 300 ten two quantity-their with an infantry of 1,312 soldiers in number (Qoedes 1930:34)\nAccording to Prentice (pers.comm.) in BRU numbers between ten and twenty are formed with sapulu + cardinal number (although Ray gives them on the basis of balas, Ray 1913:62). In BAC one finds sapulu sabua, sapulu dua, sapulu tolu for ‘eleven’, ‘twelve’, ‘thirteen’ etc. (Stokhof 1980:97-98). These three isolects agree with PMP, where teens are formed with *sa-puluq + a cardinal number.",

It sometimes alternates with 7 as in puhun,pu?un ‘tree’.\n72Grijns says that most bases with an initial cluster have a variant form with an epenthetic schwa between the consonants. Whether a group of consonants is realised as a cluster or acquires an epenthetic schwa depends among other things on the number of syllables in the lexeme. Disyllabism is favouredin the canonical shape of JKT lexemes, and the insertion of ə would often result in more than two syllables. Nevertheless, there are inherited JKT lexemes which always occur with an initial consonant cluster, and which can form a contrasting minimal pair with lexemes containing a schwa. They may have a sound-symbolic value, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a stop or s + a liquid. Sometimes they are the result either of extension of a monosyllabic lexeme, or of reduction ofanother (non-monosyllabic) lexeme, in which case they have an initial cluster consisting of a nasal + a homorganic stop. (Grijns 1981:19-28). In the word-structural interpretation underlying Abdul Chaer's dictionary, initial clusters of s + a liquid do not occur. 73This list of clusters is not exhaustive (Abdul Chaer 1976:passim).",

But for some other lexemes a different explanation is required. Most loanwords found in BH as well as in IBN must be borrowed from SM, since SM is the most probable source for lexical borrowing common to BH and IBN, and as a lingua franca it has been very influential in other languages. BH forms like barunas, tirajaŋ, puracit, and IBN forms like tərajag and parancit, have (penultimate or antepenultimate) vowels which do not occur in SM. It is possible that these vowels are due to secondary developments, but as yet there is no evidence for this. For the forms containing them (and perhaps also for BH tarabag, IBN tarabay, which has a cognate in all other isolects) the hypothesis of a trisyllabic PM reconstruction with a *-rV-sequence is more appropriate.\nThe pre-C-R in SM, SWY, and JKT may then be explained by syncope of the following vowel as a result of the tendency to disyllabicity of lexemes (4.5). This tendency, together with a counteractive tendency to avoid heterorganic consonant clusters, is probably the reason for the occurrence of variants, one with a pre-C-R, and the other with ə breaking the consonant cluster (e.g. SM barnas/baranas; SWY saxkit/saxakit ‘wooden spoon’). Another reason for assuming that pre-C-R's originated through syncope of the following vowel is that (in SM, SWY, JKT) they are always preceded by a. This a may be the result of antepenultimate neutralisation in an originally trisyllabic form. As yet I do not know what the situation in PM was, and for the time being I reconstruct:\n(a) *-r(a)- if BH and IBN have a corresponding 0; (b) *-rV- if BH and/or IBN have a following vowel (other than IBN a).",

Chapter 3 is a reconstruction of PM phonemes.

Chapter 5 deals with PM lexicon: it includes a basic vocabulary and lexicon pertaining to well-defined semantic fields. In Chapter 6 an attempt is made to reconstruct the PM affixes. Chapter 7 follows the developments from PAN to PM; an account is given of the sound changes and of the phonotactic and lexical changes that took place between PAN and PM.

Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT).

Cases of multifunctionality abound in Minangkabau morphology and the language’s lexical/derivational affixes ta-, pa- and ba- are particularly multifunctional (see Section 5.2). The correlations between the syntactic and semantic properties of the root and the meaning or syntactic function of the affix being profiled are relatively transparent. For example, ta- derives superlative forms only from stative roots and creates stative ‘ability’ predicates only from transitive verb roots. Nevertheless it remains difficult to clarify the exact correlations between the category of the root and the intended use of the affix in a number of other cases, for example the causative marker pa- when it occurs with non-stative roots (see Section 5.2.2).",

Kroeger, 1998), Minangkabau does not have any lexical specifications about a verb’s ‘default’ pivot or its basic voice. This idea is supported by the fact that, when bare verbs are used in place of voice marked verbs, the ‘voice’ of the verb and the semantic roles of the verb’s arguments are underspecified (see Section 6.1.2). This suggests that some elements of the verb’s argument structure are dependent on the surface realisation of syntactic structures and voice morphology on the verb. Rather than claiming that the unmarked verb is precategorial, we can propose that some aspects of its argument structure in Minangkabau are underspecified (see Section 6.3.2). We could also propose a solution similar to Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) and argue that some elements of argument structure are specified by the verb root and other elements are specified by the voice marker. The interaction of root with voice marker and the effects that this has on argument structure must depend on the category and semantics of the root.\n6.3.1.2 Nominalisation Processes\nAs discussed in Section 4.2.1.2, Minangkabau has productive nominalising morphology and makes use of three main nominalising affixes: pa-, paN-, and -an. Like many of the nominalising affixes used in Philippine-type languages, two of the Minangkabau nominalisers, pa- and -an, are apparently homophonous with verbal morphological markers: the causative prefix pa- and the applicative -an respectively (see Section 6.3.1.3).

This had led some linguists to propose that roots in Philippine-type languages are precategorial. That is to say, distinctions between nominal and verbal parts of speech are not made in the lexicon, instead the distinctions depend on the syntactic and morphological frames in which the roots are used. A summary of the arguments that have been made for and against a precategorial analysis of Philippine-type languages are presented in Section 6.3.1.

Zorc considers IBN lexemes with a diphthongised last syllable to be evidence for the development of PAN *5, *H, and *i’to IBN -7, which is unwarranted since there is no way of telling whether earlier (undiphthongised) forms of these lexemes had -'’or not. The lexemes in question are: tuay, umay, kitay, tubay, bugay, and n/aday, better evidence for *kitaHis IBN kita7 ‘you (plural)’ (if this is not a SAR loan, cf. 3.2.3). Furthermore, IBN (and also Mualang) have a fossilised suffix -7, which marks transitivity (see 6.1.1). It is a reflex of the PAN locative focus marker, and it corresponds to -i in Philippine and Formosan languages (Wolff 1973:73, 77). It is not likely that the -7 in IBN -i7 reflects a PAN laryngeal, since no corresponding consonant is found in Formosan or Philippine languages. But more important criticism to Zorc's sound law is that there are too many unexplained IBN exceptions. To start with, his evidence for PAN *-S > IBN -7 is too weak.110065 There are only three cases out of nine that support this correspondence, viz. dga7, pari7 and tuma7. In two cases the IBN reflexes do not provide evidence viz. tuay and paah (-h unexplained), and four reflexes provide counterevidence: tabu, tali, dai, and kuku. Evidence for PAN *-H > IBN -7 is much stronger, although here too one is left with a considerable number of exceptions. Out of 17 examples, 11 (including kita7 ‘you (plural)’) exemplify the change, viz. bara7, baru7, daki7, iu7, jawa7, jarami7, kita7, lima7, tai7, tapa7, and tau7; two do not provide evidence because of the diphthongisation of the last syllable (kitay not included), viz.\n105See fn. 102. 106Seefn. 102.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf.

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

If we apply Croft’s logic to the Minangkabau case, this would suggest that roots do not have inherent functions. Because nouns and verbs can function in nonprototypical ways without any changes to their surface forms, these roots are not inherently nominal or verbal, some roots are just more likely to occur in nominal or verbal position due to their semantics. If we take this hypothesis to its extreme, a possible conclusion is that Minangkabau roots are precategorial; that is, categories can be defined on the basis of the construction type and lexemes do not have any ‘underlying’ category membership; they acquire nominal or verbal status only when they are used in a nominal or verbal construction.\nSimilar questions have been raised about the categorical status of roots and the role of voice morphology in other Austronesian languages, particularly Philippine-type\n212",

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-.

It could also be the case that cuci and masak in (263) and (264) are intentionally left bare so that the participants muko, ‘face’, and nyo, ‘it’, are potentially both actors and undergoers thus coercing a reflexive or middle interpretation of the event.\nFinally, since the verb caliak, ‘see’, in (265a) is not marked for voice, determining the semantic roles of the participants referred to by the pronouns den and -e is a difficult task if the sentence is taken out of context.\nBoth active and passive permutations of the sentence are possible as (265b) and (265c) demonstrate; in (265b) den is the actor and -e the undergoer, whereas in (265c) den is the undergoer and -e is the actor. However, my language consultants agreed that although the passive interpretation of the sentence presented in (265c) is plausible, the interpretation presented in (265b) is preferred. This is because the way the progression of events is encoded in (265c), i.e. the speaker laughing then being looked at by someone, is unusual. It is much more likely that if the event aden galak, ‘I laughed’, is a reason or cause for the speaker to be looked at, following principles of iconicity, it ought to come after the main verb caliak, ‘see’.

It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice.

Some examples of nominalisations based on verbal roots in Kimaragang can be found in (284). Note that the -in- infix results in a semantic narrowing of the root in the nominalised forms.\n215",

In Minangkabau it is usually the pre-verbal participant that is the pivot, but if the verb is not marked for voice then it is unclear whether the pre-verbal participant is an actor or an undergoer. However, as the examples in Section 6.1.2 showed, speakers are usually able to disambiguate the semantic roles of the participants and work out what the intended ‘voice’ of the verb is.\nAs discussed in Section 6.1.2, discourse context and real world knowledge provide the clues that allow hearers to disambiguate the semantic roles of the bare verb’s arguments. If one of the arguments in the clause refers to a participant in the conversation, is the protagonist of the narrative, has had more previous mentions than another participant, or if one of the participants is definite and the other is not, then that participant will be highly referential and topical and will therefore serve as the pivot. Establishing which is an actor and which is an undergoer is more difficult. Some contextual background can also help, and so can some knowledge of the world, for example bananas are more likely to be chopped than be the ones chopping (see example (261)).",

But kə- -an( 1) etc. also occurs with verbs in SM, MIN, SWY, and JKT, and I will reconstruct a PM ancestor which occurred on the basis of verbs and nouns, and which denoted unintentionality and feasibility. As to its function of forming comparatives with VSIs in MIN and of forming excessives with VSIs in BH, this is an even smaller base for a PM reconstruction than in the case of tor- etc. with VSIs (cf. 6.2.2). Since kə- -an(V) and ter- etc. are to a great extent similar in function and meaning, a difference in distribution would be expected between them. However, I have not been able to discover any such difference that would hold for all isolects.\nAll isolects except IBN have a correspondence Of SM kə- -an(2) occurring with VSIs and forming nouns referring to the quality denoted by (VSI). JKT kə- -an(T), however, may not be inherited. SM kə- -an(2) and MIN ka- -an(2) also occur with VDIs (forming abstract nouns, and nouns referring to the place where the action is performed). In BH, ka- -an(2) is found with VDIs, but here the resulting noun exclusively refers to the place where the action is performed.

Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice.

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’.

Example (181a) shows a typical Indonesian P2 clause in which the verb beli, ‘buy’, is unmarked. In (181b) this P2 clause has been embedded in a matrix clause. If we raise the undergoer participant baju ini, ‘this shirt’, to pivot position in the matrix clause, then the sentence is grammatical, as shown in (181c). However, if we raise the first person pronoun actor saya, then an ungrammatical sentence is produced in (181d).

The origin of BH nag is also uncertain.\nSWY no is probably a secondary development of the third person possessive pronoun. Finally, the origin of IBN ti and kə are obscure; ti must be a contracted form, since in MUA tay (written ‘tai’) is found. No attempt at a reconstruction is made (the lack of comparative agreement makes it quite likely that PM did not have a relative clause marker).\n5.5.2.4 INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS Along with full interrogative pronouns, MIN has a series of short forms (a, ma, bar/a etc.,\nwritten ‘a’, ‘ma’, ‘bara’ etc. in Van der Toorn). *apa ‘what (interrogative)’ was reconstructed on the basis of reflexes in all isolects (3.1.1.4; IBN has apa (< SM or SAR?) besides nama). *mana( ?) ‘which’ is reconstructed on the basis of regular correspondences in all isolects but IBN. It should, however, be pointed out that MIN a could also be a contraction of an earlier +aha. This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2). Alongside *si-apa *sai ‘id.’ is also reconstructed on the basis of KD sad; it is not found elsewhere in the Malayic group, but cf. PMP *sa(y)i ‘id.’.",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

This results in a change in word order as the new core argument is moved to post verbal position.

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

If we apply Croft’s logic to the Minangkabau case, this would suggest that roots do not have inherent functions. Because nouns and verbs can function in nonprototypical ways without any changes to their surface forms, these roots are not inherently nominal or verbal, some roots are just more likely to occur in nominal or verbal position due to their semantics. If we take this hypothesis to its extreme, a possible conclusion is that Minangkabau roots are precategorial; that is, categories can be defined on the basis of the construction type and lexemes do not have any ‘underlying’ category membership; they acquire nominal or verbal status only when they are used in a nominal or verbal construction.\nSimilar questions have been raised about the categorical status of roots and the role of voice morphology in other Austronesian languages, particularly Philippine-type\n212",

According to Schachter (1976; 1977), in Philippine-type languages, there is a division of these role and reference related properties of subjects between the actor and the pivot. The reference related properties of subjects, such as the ability to be relativised and to launch floating quantifiers, correspond most closely to the function of the pivot, whereas the role related properties are performed by the actor participant, whether the actor is aligned with the pivot function or not (see below).\n\nFoley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) argue that voice in Philippine-type languages constitutes a realignment between the grammatical function of pivot and semantic role. This means that voice marking on the verb changes according to the semantic role of the participant that is selected to be the pivot. Philippine-type languages are conservative (when compared to Indonesian-type languages) and have rich voice systems that allow for a range of different participant types to be selected as pivot (Ross, 2002).\n\nTagalog is described as having four voices, as example (5) demonstrates.\n\n(5) a. b. c. d.\n\nMag-salis\n\nang babae ng bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nACT:TOP-will-take-out TOP woman GOAL rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘The woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisin\n\nng babae ang bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nGOAL:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman TOP rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take the rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisan\n\nng babae ng bigasang sako para.sa bata.\n\nDIR:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice TOP sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of the sack for a/the child.’\n\nIpag-salis\n\nng babae ng bigas sa sako ang bata.\n\nBENF:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice DIR sack TOP child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for the child.’",

He further explains that the roots must take on nominal or verbal properties according to the construction in which they are used. He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Perhaps bare verb constructions don’t represent some kind of defective or underspecified version of a voice marked verb construction.

This would correspond with SUN aha and KD ahe ‘what?’ and would eventually lead to a PM form *aha. 175\nIn all isolects, the interrogative pronoun referring to place consists of a locative preposition prefixed optionally in SM to the interrogative pronoun meaning ‘which’, hence *-mana(7) ‘where’.\n*si-apa ‘who’ has been reconstructed on the basis of evidence from all isolects (3.1.3.2).

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class. However, this distinction is not captured by Chomsky’s (1970) classification framework.\n\n(22) a. John pounded the metal flat.\n\n(AP)\n\nb. John threw the ball into the barrel.

He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity. Clauses with N- marked verbs were irrealis, stative, off the timeline of the main narrative events, and more likely to have non-referential patients. Clauses with di- marked verbs, on the other hand, were\n26\n\n\findicative, eventive, and on the timeline of the main narrative events. These clauses were also more likely to have referential patients that were individuated, animate, and that had continuous mention throughout the text (Wouk, 1989: 132-40).",

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

In OM ‘twelve’ occurs in the following line of the Kedukan Bukit inscription (Palembang):\ndagan jalan saribu tluratus sapulu dua vanak-na with infantry 1,000 300 ten two quantity-their with an infantry of 1,312 soldiers in number (Qoedes 1930:34)\nAccording to Prentice (pers.comm.) in BRU numbers between ten and twenty are formed with sapulu + cardinal number (although Ray gives them on the basis of balas, Ray 1913:62). In BAC one finds sapulu sabua, sapulu dua, sapulu tolu for ‘eleven’, ‘twelve’, ‘thirteen’ etc. (Stokhof 1980:97-98). These three isolects agree with PMP, where teens are formed with *sa-puluq + a cardinal number.",

Zorc considers IBN lexemes with a diphthongised last syllable to be evidence for the development of PAN *5, *H, and *i’to IBN -7, which is unwarranted since there is no way of telling whether earlier (undiphthongised) forms of these lexemes had -'’or not. The lexemes in question are: tuay, umay, kitay, tubay, bugay, and n/aday, better evidence for *kitaHis IBN kita7 ‘you (plural)’ (if this is not a SAR loan, cf. 3.2.3). Furthermore, IBN (and also Mualang) have a fossilised suffix -7, which marks transitivity (see 6.1.1). It is a reflex of the PAN locative focus marker, and it corresponds to -i in Philippine and Formosan languages (Wolff 1973:73, 77). It is not likely that the -7 in IBN -i7 reflects a PAN laryngeal, since no corresponding consonant is found in Formosan or Philippine languages. But more important criticism to Zorc's sound law is that there are too many unexplained IBN exceptions. To start with, his evidence for PAN *-S > IBN -7 is too weak.110065 There are only three cases out of nine that support this correspondence, viz. dga7, pari7 and tuma7. In two cases the IBN reflexes do not provide evidence viz. tuay and paah (-h unexplained), and four reflexes provide counterevidence: tabu, tali, dai, and kuku. Evidence for PAN *-H > IBN -7 is much stronger, although here too one is left with a considerable number of exceptions.

This fact strongly supports the idea that SWY -k is innovative, and hence that SWY -7 is the regular correspondence to MIN -7, o.i. -k. A possible objection to a SM origin of balik, luk and tasik is that these lexemes should have had a -? on account of the fact that SM realises final -k as p]. But then again, SWY speakers would most likely interpret this SM pj as [k] on account of the fact that the preceding vowels are monophthongs. (SWY, which has [-i®?], [-u®?], [-uk] and [-ik] sequences, does not have [-i7] or [-u7] sequences, 3.1.2.)\n(b) IBN The origin of IBN -7 is problematic. Zorc (1982:115) assumes that -7 is the result of a merger of PAN *S (corresponding to -s in Formosan languages, and -h- (at morpheme boundaries) in Philippine languages), *H (corresponding to -h in some Formosan languages, and to -h- at morpheme boundaries in some Philippine languages), and *7 (corresponding to -7 in some Philippine and Formosan languages). The evidence for this theory is shown in the following correspondences (in my evaluation of Zorc's theory I restrict myself to criticism of his IBN evidence. In order to show that JKT -'’does not reflect any of the PAN laryngeals, evidence from this isolect is added to Zorc's list, see below).\nZorc's evidence for PAN *-$:\nPAN *C21iS ‘line, string’ > IBN, JKT tali; PAN *daqiS ‘forehead’ > IBN dai-, PAN *ku(S)kuS ‘fingernail’ > IBN kuku ‘claw’, JKT kuku ‘fingernail’; PAN *pa:qaS W2 ‘thigh’ > IBN paah (-h unexplained), JKT pa/ɪd (-/ɪ- unexplained); PAN *tuqaS ‘old (people)’ > IBN tuay, JKT tud; PAN *tSbuS ‘sugarcane’ > IBN təbu, JKT tabu7; PHF *CiijaS ‘food particles caught between the teeth’ > IBN tiŋa7.\nTo these reconstructions I add *Cu:meS and *pa:RiS (see below).110032\nZorc's evidence for PAN *-H:",

But for some other lexemes a different explanation is required. Most loanwords found in BH as well as in IBN must be borrowed from SM, since SM is the most probable source for lexical borrowing common to BH and IBN, and as a lingua franca it has been very influential in other languages. BH forms like barunas, tirajaŋ, puracit, and IBN forms like tərajag and parancit, have (penultimate or antepenultimate) vowels which do not occur in SM. It is possible that these vowels are due to secondary developments, but as yet there is no evidence for this. For the forms containing them (and perhaps also for BH tarabag, IBN tarabay, which has a cognate in all other isolects) the hypothesis of a trisyllabic PM reconstruction with a *-rV-sequence is more appropriate.\nThe pre-C-R in SM, SWY, and JKT may then be explained by syncope of the following vowel as a result of the tendency to disyllabicity of lexemes (4.5). This tendency, together with a counteractive tendency to avoid heterorganic consonant clusters, is probably the reason for the occurrence of variants, one with a pre-C-R, and the other with ə breaking the consonant cluster (e.g. SM barnas/baranas; SWY saxkit/saxakit ‘wooden spoon’). Another reason for assuming that pre-C-R's originated through syncope of the following vowel is that (in SM, SWY, JKT) they are always preceded by a. This a may be the result of antepenultimate neutralisation in an originally trisyllabic form. As yet I do not know what the situation in PM was, and for the time being I reconstruct:\n(a) *-r(a)- if BH and IBN have a corresponding 0; (b) *-rV- if BH and/or IBN have a following vowel (other than IBN a).",

In BAC one finds sapulu sabua, sapulu dua, sapulu tolu for ‘eleven’, ‘twelve’, ‘thirteen’ etc. (Stokhof 1980:97-98).

Zorc considers IBN lexemes with a diphthongised last syllable to be evidence for the development of PAN *5, *H, and *i’to IBN -7, which is unwarranted since there is no way of telling whether earlier (undiphthongised) forms of these lexemes had -'’or not. The lexemes in question are: tuay, umay, kitay, tubay, bugay, and n/aday, better evidence for *kitaHis IBN kita7 ‘you (plural)’ (if this is not a SAR loan, cf. 3.2.3). Furthermore, IBN (and also Mualang) have a fossilised suffix -7, which marks transitivity (see 6.1.1). It is a reflex of the PAN locative focus marker, and it corresponds to -i in Philippine and Formosan languages (Wolff 1973:73, 77). It is not likely that the -7 in IBN -i7 reflects a PAN laryngeal, since no corresponding consonant is found in Formosan or Philippine languages. But more important criticism to Zorc's sound law is that there are too many unexplained IBN exceptions. To start with, his evidence for PAN *-S > IBN -7 is too weak.110065 There are only three cases out of nine that support this correspondence, viz. dga7, pari7 and tuma7. In two cases the IBN reflexes do not provide evidence viz. tuay and paah (-h unexplained), and four reflexes provide counterevidence: tabu, tali, dai, and kuku. Evidence for PAN *-H > IBN -7 is much stronger, although here too one is left with a considerable number of exceptions. Out of 17 examples, 11 (including kita7 ‘you (plural)’) exemplify the change, viz. bara7, baru7, daki7, iu7, jawa7, jarami7, kita7, lima7, tai7, tapa7, and tau7; two do not provide evidence because of the diphthongisation of the last syllable (kitay not included), viz.\n105See fn. 102. 106Seefn. 102.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

First, the characterisation of voice relies heavily on the nature of grammatical relations in the language. Second, in addition to the syntactic processes that motivate voice, it is also essential to consider the motivating discourse/pragmatic factors involved. Third, as well as encoding syntactic distinctions, voice marking may also encode semantic and conceptual distinctions such as aspectual notions. This third issue is especially important to consider for pivotless languages like Acehnese, since ‘voice’ marking does not encode grammatical relations in this kind of language. These theoretical themes also heavily inform my characterisation of the syntactic, discourse/pragmatic, and semantic properties of voice in Minangkabau (see Chapter 5).\n40\n\n\f41",

There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf.

Some Austronesian voice markers also have aspectual qualities which may be linked with their role in showing semantic and conceptual notions (cf. Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

The other participants in the clause are marked by articles that show their semantic role; for example the benefactor bata, ‘child’, is marked by the benefactive composite para sa and so on.\nSentences (5b), (5c) and (5d) show the three other Tagalog voice types. In (5b) the verb is marked for goal voice, meaning that the goal bigas, ‘rice’, is the pivot. In (5c) the direction is the pivot therefore the verb is marked for locative voice, and in (5d) the benefactor is pivot therefore the verb is marked for benefactive voice.\nAn additional typologically salient feature of Philippine-type voice systems is that they are symmetrical (Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2005; 2008). This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6). Thus, voice marking in Philippine-type languages also has a verbal derivational function.\n2.2 Indonesian-type Voice",

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

Only the affixation of certain word classes, namely that of verbs and nouns, is discussed; reduplication is not treated.\nOngoing research has yet to produce a watertight set of criteria for word-class membership in SM, and this topic needs much further investigation in each of the isolects. I restrict myself here to a syntactical definition of verbs and nouns in SM. The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them.

These lexemes are called precategorials.181 Since precategorials are usually the base of verbal and nominal derivations, they will be included here. Precategorial bases will be indicated by a preceding hyphen, and their meanings will be given between brackets.\nOther verb classes are not distinguished. Apart from VTRs and VDIs, Muhadjir (1981:13), in his treatment of word classes in JKT, also distinguishes “semi-transitives” along with adjectives, intransitive verbs, and transitive verbs (which are comparable to VSIs, VDIs, and VTRs respectively in this study). Semi-transitives have co-constituents, but these are complements, not objects: since the semi-transitives have no object-oriented form these complements can only be made subject by the use of transitive (derived) verb forms. The co-constituents are often introduced with amd (also translatable as ‘with, towards’). Reciprocal verbs all belong to the category of semi-transitives because they usually also have co-constituents. Muhadjir's “semi-transitives” could be distinguished on the same terms for SM as for JKT: SM also has a class of verbs which can govern a complement which, however, cannot function as subject vis-a-vis these verbs (e.g. suka Tike (s.th. or s.o.)’, tahu ‘know (s.th.)’, bəlajar ‘study, learn (s.th.)’, bərbieara ‘speak (a language)’; these verbs do not require a preposition). Rather than adding another subclass of verbs to the ones already distinguished here, I prefer to consider Muhadjir's semi-transitives as a subclass of VDIs that have the faculty of taking a complement (which may or may not be introduced by a preposition), which is in correlation with their semantics.\nAs far as PM is concerned, I do not make any attempt to reconstruct the word-class system although I assume that comparable word classes must have existed. The precategorials in particular have an uncertain status in PM.",

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity. Clauses with N- marked verbs were irrealis, stative, off the timeline of the main narrative events, and more likely to have non-referential patients. Clauses with di- marked verbs, on the other hand, were\n26\n\n\findicative, eventive, and on the timeline of the main narrative events. These clauses were also more likely to have referential patients that were individuated, animate, and that had continuous mention throughout the text (Wouk, 1989: 132-40).",

According to Langacker, nouns involve summary scanning; we need only to glance at an object summarily in order to tell what kind of object it is. Similarly adjectives describe some kind of static quality inherent in the noun. Langacker (1987b) argues that this means we conceptualise the properties encoded by adjectives in a summary way. He argues that verbs, on the other hand, involve change over time, therefore we supposedly perceive events in a sequential way; a snapshot view of a person mid-motion will not tell us if that person is standing, jumping, running, falling or involved in any number of other\n54",

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language.

The implicit application of these definitions (and that of precategorials, see below) to other isolects has proven to be satisfactory for the aims pursued in this chapter. In SM, verbs are defined as lexical entities which can be modified by the negation marker tidak.\nVerbs are divided into two main categories:\n(a) transitive verbs (VTR), which can occur in object-oriented constructions and which govern an object (O);\n(b) intransitive verbs (VI), which do not occur in object-oriented constructions. Intransitive verbs are further subdivided into dynamic intransitive verbs (VDI) which refer to an action, a process, or a change of state, and stative intransitive verbs (VSI) which refer to a state of affairs.\nSyntactic differences between VSIs and VDIs include the following:\n(1) VSIs cannot be modified by the aspect markers təlah, akan, ahdsədag (denoting perfect, non-commenced, and ongoing action respectively; other aspect markers such as sudah (completed action) occur with both VSIs and VDIs).\n(2) Unlike VSIs, VDIs cannot modify nouns directly, but must be placed within a relative clause (cf. anak nakal, anak yag nakal ‘naughty child’, but *anak tidurvs anak yag tidur ‘sleeping child’).\n(3) VDIs cannot function as complements of (mən)jadi ‘become’ (to be distinguished from jadi ‘succeed, manage’).",

Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

However, he argues that the aspectual distinctions are a result of some clauses being foregrounding, i.e. they are central to the development of the narrative and are perfective, and some clauses being backgrounding, i.e. they provide information that supports, but is not central to, the main events of the narrative and are imperfective. He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.",

In a typical transitive clause an active transitive verb root functions as the head and is marked by the active voice prefix maN-. Adjuncts do not form part of the predicate’s core argument structure and are marked by a preposition. Like active intransitives, active transitive predicates can be marked by the active voice marker maN-. Example (96) illustrates a canonical active transitive clause with the active transitive predicate mancuci, ‘wash’. Notice that sabun, ‘soap’, is marked by the preposition jo because it is an adjunct.\n\n(96)\n\nInyo mancuci tangannyo jo sabun.\n\n3 AV-wash hand-3\n\nwith soap\n\n‘He washed his hands with soap.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

For example, in (167) note that the stative verb root dingin, ‘cold’, must be marked by the applicative clitic -an in order to be passivised. The applicative transitivises the verb root, creating a causative verb which requires both an actor (-nyo) and an undergoer (nasi tu, ‘the rice’).\n\n(167) a.\n\nNasi tu\n\ndidinginannyo.\n\nrice DEM:dist PV-cold-APP-3\n\n‘He has cooled the rice down.’\n\nb. *Nasi tu\n\ndidinginnyo.\n\nrice DEM:dist PV-cold-3\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSimilarly in (168), the -an applicative is required to transitivise the active intransitive verb root suruak, ‘hide’, in order for it to be passivised.\n\n(168) a. b.\n\nKue disuruakannyo.\ncake PV-hide-APP-3\n‘He hid the cake.’\n*Kue disuruaknyo.\ncake PV-hide-3\n(Elicitation)\n\nTransitive verb roots do not require an applicative in order to be passivised because they already have the required number and type of arguments.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’.

Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice.

In (21a) notice that the verb is followed by the actor, the first person pronoun aku, and then the patient, laser, ‘ a laser’. However, in (21b) the verb is followed by the patient, nasi goreng, ‘fried rice’, and then the actor, aku.",

Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Conducting elicitation was an essential stage in the process of understanding these bare verb forms because I was able to ask speakers about the restrictions on using these bare forms and also to test the productivity and use of these forms in syntactic and pragmatic contexts not found in the corpus.\n5 An Aqiqa is a Muslim ceremony in which a new born baby is named. 45",

For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

The MIN and BH forms are problematic: they may have have developed from a morphologically complex pre-PM form *i-ni-ia, or from a (post-?) PM combination *ia + *na with contraction of *ia to i (or to a in MIN ano/ano; pronouns are often subject to irregular shortening and contraction), cf. SM diana ‘(3rd pers. sg./pl.)’ (Gerth van Wijk p.221; Klinkert). *ia was reconstructed for the third person singular (3.4.2.6), which is also in agreement with PMP *si-ia (Blust 1977a: 11).\nA cliticised form of the third person is SM, BH -na, MIN -no/-no/-o/-e; in IBN the full form is used. SM, MIN, BH, SWY, and JKT reflect *-na; the PMP ancestral form of *-na is *ni-a (Blust 1977a:10-l 1) in which a merger of the alveolar nasal with following *i into a palatal nasal had not yet taken place. Some isolects have a third person plural pronoun. One of these, IBN sida?, reflects PMP *si-iDa (Blust 1977a: 11), and PM *sida ? is reconstructed.\nThe other pronouns are later developments: SM məreka (itu)/marika (itu) does not occur in early Classical Malay texts, nor does it have correspondences in other isolects that are not felt to be originally SM. Marika is described as ‘a people’ in Howison (1801) and as ‘people, persons; an armour-bearer, esquire’ in Marsden (1812). It may be borrowed from Old Javanese, which has marika, an emphatic article which apparently also functioned as a*\nvery likely, but the connection of b- with +(a)ba is too conjectural.

As to its function of forming comparatives with VSIs in MIN and of forming excessives with VSIs in BH, this is an even smaller base for a PM reconstruction than in the case of tor- etc. with VSIs (cf. 6.2.2).

Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant.

As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

Examples (210) to (212) show how ba- can function to mark reflexive predicates. In this kind of construction the event described is active but it does not affect an undergoer participant. Instead, the action affects the actor as well. Some reflexive predicates can be encoded like a simple active clause with the use of a reflexive pronoun in undergoer position. For example, in (209) diri, ‘self’, is used as a reflexive pronoun much like the English reflexive pronoun ‘himself’. The pronoun occupies undergoer position in this example and the clause resembles a simple active construction. However, reflexive predicates marked by the ba- prefix do not require an undergoer argument because the actor is also understood as the ‘affectee’.\n\n(209)\n\nInyo bunuah diri.\n\n3 kill\n\nself\n\n‘He killed himself.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nIn example (210) a reflexive predicate baraja has been created from the transitive verb root aja ‘teach’ and the reflexive marker ba-.

The resultant forms bapikia and basangko translate literally as ‘think to oneself’ and ‘suspect to oneself’. Experiential predicates, particularly predicates denoting cognitive processes are encoded as reflexives in a\n162\n\n\fnumber of languages (Kemmer, 1994) so it is not unusual for these forms to exist in Minangkabau.\n\n(211) (212)",

                "content": "Acehnese has a system of pronominal marking on its verbs which cross-references the agent and undergoer arguments. Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Further investigation is required to test this. However, a similar opposition also exists between the Standard Indonesian causative prefix per- and the applicative -kan. Alwi et al (1998) argue that the perverbs express an increase in the quality named by the stative verb root whereas the -kan verbs describe a complete change of state. So in Indonesian these two affixes encode similar processes: per- focuses on the origin of the event whereas -kan shows its end point.\nIn examples (203) to (206) the function of the prefix pa- is less easy to predict. In these examples pa- has a different semantic effect when it affixes to active verb roots aja, ‘teach’, duduak, ‘sit’, tagak, ‘stand’, and cuci, ‘wash’. The effect of applicative marking on each of these verbs is also different and this also has an effect on how pa- interacts with the applicatives.",

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.",

By the same token, the function of intransitive verb marker must be attributed to *mAN(2)-. As the PM ancestor of di- was not yet a prefix (as will be seen below), there is no reason to consider it as the object-oriented couhterpart of PM *mAN(l)-. The only difference between *mAN(l )-and *mAN(2)- was that one was prefixed to VTRs and the other to VDIs. For this reason it is simpler to reconstruct only PM *mAN- as an active verb marker which was prefixed to both VDIs and VTRs, and to regard the functional differentiation as a later development.\n\nHowever, it is relevant in this respect that in KD and SD, the function of N(l)(corresponding to SM məiv(l)- etc.) is not primarily that of marking agent-orientedness. Nalso occurs in object-oriented verbs: N- conveys here the realis mood, that is, it indicates that an act is really taking place, or has really taken place. Conversely, the absence of N- in object-oriented verbs indicates that the act has not (yet) taken place, or will not take place (which includes negative sentences, imperatives and subjunctives). (N- is also absent in series of consecutive verbs which are used for describing a process.) In the examples below all sentences are in the realis mood except for (27), which expresses an intention. This irrealis-realis distinction may be an exclusive innovation in KD and SD, but it is also reminiscent of the PAN morphological distinction between independent and dependent verbal forms (cf. Wolff 1973).\n\nSM di- and its correspondences is prefixed to object-oriented verbs when the agent is a third person. The correspondence of SM di- in the other isolects is also di-.

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

Examples (210) to (212) show how ba- can function to mark reflexive predicates. In this kind of construction the event described is active but it does not affect an undergoer participant. Instead, the action affects the actor as well. Some reflexive predicates can be encoded like a simple active clause with the use of a reflexive pronoun in undergoer position. For example, in (209) diri, ‘self’, is used as a reflexive pronoun much like the English reflexive pronoun ‘himself’. The pronoun occupies undergoer position in this example and the clause resembles a simple active construction. However, reflexive predicates marked by the ba- prefix do not require an undergoer argument because the actor is also understood as the ‘affectee’.\n\n(209)\n\nInyo bunuah diri.\n\n3 kill\n\nself\n\n‘He killed himself.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nIn example (210) a reflexive predicate baraja has been created from the transitive verb root aja ‘teach’ and the reflexive marker ba-.

Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo.

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively.

Further investigation is required to test this. However, a similar opposition also exists between the Standard Indonesian causative prefix per- and the applicative -kan. Alwi et al (1998) argue that the perverbs express an increase in the quality named by the stative verb root whereas the -kan verbs describe a complete change of state. So in Indonesian these two affixes encode similar processes: per- focuses on the origin of the event whereas -kan shows its end point.\nIn examples (203) to (206) the function of the prefix pa- is less easy to predict. In these examples pa- has a different semantic effect when it affixes to active verb roots aja, ‘teach’, duduak, ‘sit’, tagak, ‘stand’, and cuci, ‘wash’.

Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo.

Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT).

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively.

Further investigation is required to test this. However, a similar opposition also exists between the Standard Indonesian causative prefix per- and the applicative -kan. Alwi et al (1998) argue that the perverbs express an increase in the quality named by the stative verb root whereas the -kan verbs describe a complete change of state. So in Indonesian these two affixes encode similar processes: per- focuses on the origin of the event whereas -kan shows its end point.\nIn examples (203) to (206) the function of the prefix pa- is less easy to predict. In these examples pa- has a different semantic effect when it affixes to active verb roots aja, ‘teach’, duduak, ‘sit’, tagak, ‘stand’, and cuci, ‘wash’.

In Minangkabau, possession is not morphologically marked on the noun. Instead, the verb punyo, ‘have’, is used to show a possessive relationship between the possessor and the possessed (see example (30)). Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo.

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one.

One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT. Solution (4) yields more perspectives, because it fits in with the fact that JKT -an(l) also seems to be borrowed. Furthermore, JKT has only two suffixes",

Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT). Fourthly, the syntactical role of SM paN- and MIN paN- is quite different from the (more restricted) role of their correspondences in other isolects.

Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

In Minangkabau, possession is not morphologically marked on the noun. Instead, the verb punyo, ‘have’, is used to show a possessive relationship between the possessor and the possessed (see example (30)). Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo.

For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one.

Secondly, all isolects agree in forming nouns or VSIs referring to an inclination or characteristic by prefixing paN- etc. to a VSI. Thirdly, in all isolects paN- etc. in some cases also forms nouns referring to the actor or to the instrument, and abstract nouns; MIN has abstract nouns only with the connotation of the action ‘as a habit’; paN- forms referring to the object are found in SM, SWY, IBN, and JKT (i.e. the word for ‘gift’ in SM, SWY, JKT).

One could argue that this ancestor did not have the meaning of reciprocity, because in the above four isolects -an(l) usually co-occurs with bər- etc. when forming reciprocal forms, and reciprocity is then already indicated by the prefix. (If this line of reasoning holds, then -an(l) probably has the same function whether suffixed to VDIs or VTRs, since plurality of subject is a consequence of reciprocity.) On the basis of -an(2) in all isolects, a PM ancestral form can be reconstructed which was suffixed to VSIs and VTRs. Suffixed to VSIs it denoted something with the quality of (VSI); suffixed to VTRs it referred to the goal, result or location of the act. Such an ancestral form, however, would correspond to two PMP suffixes: *-an (referring to the place where an act is performed), and *-en (referring to the object of an act), which would have yielded JKT +-an and +-an. But JKT only has one nominalising suffix -an. There are four possible solutions for this apparent inconsistency: (1) JKT does not distinguish PMP *a and *e in final syllables, (2) PM merged PMP *-an and *-en to *-an, (3) JKT has merged PM *-an and *-an to -an, or (4) JKT -an(2) is innovative. As far as solution (1) is concerned, it. was seen in Chapter 3 that the JKT distinction of a and ə in final syllables must be inherited. Solutions (2) and (3) are also unlikely, because if the distinction between JKT final-syllable a and ə is inherited (and therefore reflects PM *a and *a), there is no a priori reason why PMP *-an and *-en would have merged in PM, or in JKT. Solution (4) yields more perspectives, because it fits in with the fact that JKT -an(l) also seems to be borrowed. Furthermore, JKT has only two suffixes",

Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

The Minangkabau applicatives -an and -i are for the most part valency changing devices but operate within both the pragmatic and conceptual domains of Minangkabau voice. The active voice marker maN- also operates in both pragmatic and conceptual domains whereas the use of the passive voice marker di- is primarily motivated by pragmatic and syntactic factors. This analysis is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic whereas the conceptual voice markers are affixes and have mainly lexico-semantic properties.\n1",

Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

Foregrounded clauses are typically realis and are associated with perfective or telic aspect.\nHopper and Thompson (1980) also argue that passive clauses are associated with telic aspect. In passive clauses, the undergoer is conceptually salient and highly referential. According to Hopper and Thompson, this suggests that the undergoer is highly individuated, which in turn also means that the clause is high in transitivity. Another feature of clauses high in transitivity is that they are associated with telic aspect due to the degree of affectedness of the undergoer. Thus di- clauses in Minangkabau can be given a telic reading not because aspectual marking is a direct property of di-, but because di- clauses are high in transitivity.\n5.1.4 The Pasif Semu\nIn Standard Minangkabau, there is another kind of passive voice construction called the pasif semu (henceforth the P2 construction). Like a di- passive, the undergoer in a P2 construction performs the pivot function. However, unlike a di- passive, the actor in a P2 construction retains its status as a core argument. The P2 verb is unmarked yet the construction remains distinctive from a bare active construction because of the word order constraints it exhibits. However, due to the high frequency of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau, the P2 is not a distinctive construction in this variety (see Section 3.3 and Section 6.1.2.4).",

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function.

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-.

In (11) we see an example of active voice used in a clause containing background information.

Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice.

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

The applicatives -an and -i, although functioning primarily in the syntactic domain as valency changing devices, also function as part of Minangkabau’s conceptually motivated voice system to show the termination of the action (see Section 5.3).

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

This meant that their answer would then provide contrastive focus between the two possible answers. In (113b) the answer Udin is given, but this answer should be understood in context; i.e. it was Udin that bought the new car (rather than somebody else). Since the answer Udin provides contrastive focus, this means that Udin the NP is referentially salient and therefore selected as the pivot. This in turn triggers active voice marking on the verb since Udin is an actor. Notice that although (113c) is grammatically well formed, in this context it is infelicitous (as shown by the # symbol).

This example comes from a conversation about traditional weddings. The topic of this particular conversation, i.e. what the conversation is about, is isi jalange, ‘the contents of the wedding gift’. Being the discourse topic, isi jalange is necessarily referentially salient and is interpreted as the unexpressed pivot, the undergoer argument specified by the verb the verb dicaliak, ‘examined’, in (112b).\n\n(112) a. b.\n\nNyo kan ditanyo a isi\n\njalange.\n\n3 EMPH PV-ask what contents wedding.gift-3\n\n‘They were asked what was in the wedding gift.’\n\n(Text ID: 113014112832080506)\n\nØ Dicaliak dek urang ma.\nØ PV-look CAUSE person EMPH\n‘(The contents of the wedding gift) were examined by people.’\n\n(Text ID: 570264113048080506)\n\nArguments are selected as pivots because they are highly referential and discourse topical. Arguments are discourse topical if their referents are participants in the conversation. Arguments are also discourse topical if they have a high number of mentions in the discourse, i.e. if the discourse is about these particular participants\n\n12 A transcript of the Minangkabau folk tale ‘Yang Lamah Yang Cadiak or The Weak and The Cunning’, from which these examples are taken, can be found in Appendix 4.\n107\n\n\f(Wouk, 1989). The referential saliency of arguments can also be determined by the pragmatic effects of contrastive focus (Arka, 2003a).",

The actor argument is understood from the context since its referent is the topic of conversation. The omission of the undergoer in (152a) means that the utterance is vague, but nonetheless well formed.

In addition to this, Fortin also claims that clauses which have omitted arguments are illegal if the verb is unmarked.",

Her analysis draws on Hopper and Thompson’s (1980) Transitivity Hypothesis, which works on the grounds that a clause can be assigned a level of transitivity on a continuum ranging from high to low transitivity. The level of transitivity is assigned according to the Transitivity Schema, which is presented in Table 3.\n\n3 A similar phenomenon also occurs in Colloquial Minangkabau (see Chapter 6). 25\n\n\fTable 3.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

The high discourse relevance of the argument is reflected morphologically in that it triggers corresponding verbal marking, and syntactically by the fact that it has control over a number of restricted syntactic constructions. Thus in pragmatically motivated voice systems the notion of discourse relevance has been grammaticalised.\n104",
