To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun.

Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties.

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

He further explains that the roots must take on nominal or verbal properties according to the construction in which they are used. He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

He further explains that the roots must take on nominal or verbal properties according to the construction in which they are used. He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice. The sentences in (21) show two Riau Indonesian ‘neutral’ constructions in which the verb beli, ‘buy’, is unmarked.\n\n(21) a.\n\nBeli aku laser, kan.\nbuy 1sg laser Q\n‘I’ll buy a laser, right.’ [Context: Contemplating a shopping trip.]\n\n38\n\n\fb. Beli nasi goreng aku.\n\nbuy rice fry\n\n1sg\n\n‘I bought the fried rice.’\n\n[Context: Group of people decide they want to play cards; somebody tells\n\nspeaker to go out and buy some; speaker objects on the grounds that it's\n\nsomebody else's turn to go out.]\n\n(Gil, 2006: 43)\n\nLike the generalised active and passive constructions, a ‘neutral’ construction does not entail any shift in grammatical relations and actor and patient NPs are unrestricted in terms of which position in the clause they can appear. In (21a) notice that the verb is followed by the actor, the first person pronoun aku, and then the patient, laser, ‘ a laser’. However, in (21b) the verb is followed by the patient, nasi goreng, ‘fried rice’, and then the actor, aku.",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions.

The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents.

Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one.

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

In this example the comparative marker labiah, ‘more’, on pendek, ‘short’, is missing but the interpretation shorter is still available. The comparative reading relies on the presence of the prepositional phrase dari pisau tu.\n\n(80)\n\nPisau ko\n\npendek dari pisau tu.\n\nknife DEM:prox short\n\nfrom knife DEM:dist\n\n‘This knife is shorter than that one.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n89\n\n\fNon-gradable states do no co-occur with comparative markers because they represent inherent polar states. Example (81) illustrates the use of the non-gradable stative predicate mati, ‘dead’. Stative predicates, like all predicate constructions, can be modified by preceding TAM adverbials. In (81) the TAM adverbial alah is used to mark perfective aspect. It is inserted before the stative predicate mati, but after the undergoer, maliang tu, ‘the thief’.\n\n(81)\n\nMaliang tu\n\nalah mati.\n\nthief\n\nDEM:dist PFCT dead\n\n‘The thief died.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAnother feature of stative predicates is that they productively derive active transitive verbs with the addition of active voice morphology and the applicative -an. Most active transitive verbs derived from statives this way will have a causative meaning. In (82) the active transitive verb mandinginan, ‘to cause to be cold’, has been derived by adding the active voice prefix maN- and the applicative -an to the stative root dingin.\n\n(82)\n\nAmbo mandinginan gulai.\n\n1sg AV-cold-APP curry\n\n‘I’m cooling down the curry.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes.

Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

He further explains that the roots must take on nominal or verbal properties according to the construction in which they are used. He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Crowley, 2002), nor does it have regular diminutive forming processes.\n\nSome examples of these formal properties of Minangkabau nouns follow in examples (27) to (35). Example (27) shows number marking, examples (28) and (29) show how numerical classifiers work, examples (30), (31) and (32) show how possession is marked, example (33) shows how nouns can also be modified by attributive nouns, and examples (34) and (35) show the use of demonstratives.\n\nExample (27) shows a Minangkabau noun that is marked for number. Number is not morphologically marked in Minangkabau, instead numerals precede the noun. Example (27) illustrates this; the noun taun, year, is preceded by the numeral tigo.\n\n(27)\n\nLai tigo taun lebih kurang.\n\nmore three year more less\n\n‘More or less three years ago.’\n\n(Text ID: 979548152848070306)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also marked by numerical classifiers. Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

Cases of multifunctionality abound in Minangkabau morphology and the language’s lexical/derivational affixes ta-, pa- and ba- are particularly multifunctional (see Section 5.2). The correlations between the syntactic and semantic properties of the root and the meaning or syntactic function of the affix being profiled are relatively transparent.

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

Inherent properties of nouns:\n\nNumber\n\n• Nouns are modified for number but this is not\n\nmorphologically marked.\n\n• Noun roots are reduplicated to show plurality (in contrast to verb roots which are reduplicated to encode aspectual notions).\n\nGender/Classifiers Diminutives Definiteness/deictic status\n\n• There is a singular/plural distinction encoded in pronouns.\n• Numerical classifiers are used when counting but they are not morphologically marked.\n• There are no diminutive forming processes in Minangkabau.\n• Demonstratives are used to show the deictic status of nouns.\n\n2. Relational properties of nouns: Case/grammatical relations •\n\nBenefactive, instrumental, comitative, recipient and location non-core arguments are marked by specific prepositions.\n\nPossession\n\n• There is no marking of core grammatical relations on nouns; pivot and non-pivot arguments are determined by verbal marking, referential status and word order.\n• Possession is not morphologically marked on nouns.\n\n3. Agreement properties of nouns:\n\nPossessive structures\n\n• Possessive structures such as alienable/inalienable\n\npossession do not exist in Minangkabau.\n\nFrom Table 9 it is evident that Minangkabau nouns exhibit a number of the formal properties of nouns described by Anderson (1985), although none of these are morphologically marked except plurality. Noun plurals are created by reduplicating the substantive word (although a single non-reduplicated noun root can also be interpreted as plural if the context requires it). Example (23) shows how the noun root sanak, ‘sibling’, is reduplicated to indicate plurality.\n\n60\n\n\f(23)\n\nSanak-sank den.\n\nRED-sibling 1sg\n\n‘My siblings.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them.

For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

He states that there are a number of differences in how voice affixation patterns with nominal and verbal roots in Tagalog. Most importantly, voice affixation is obligatory and productive with verbal roots, but it is optional and unsystematic with nominal roots and creates forms with highly unpredictable semantics. Moreover, for verbal roots, voice affixation functions to select different arguments as the pivot but does not change the lexical meaning of the root. However, for nominal roots, different voice affixes on the same root create forms that range greatly in meaning.\n\nPrecategorial languages must be both bidirectional and compositional, i.e. any substantive root must be able to function in any available syntactic slot and any morphological devices must have the same effects on all roots (cf. Evans and Osada, 2005). Therefore, Kroeger’s (1998) evidence that the effects of voice affixation on nominal roots are unpredictable provides the most convincing argument to support the idea that there is indeed a lexical distinction between nominal and verbal roots in Philippine-type languages.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison.

Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1).

Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny.

For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

He further explains that the roots must take on nominal or verbal properties according to the construction in which they are used. He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Crowley, 2002), nor does it have regular diminutive forming processes.\n\nSome examples of these formal properties of Minangkabau nouns follow in examples (27) to (35). Example (27) shows number marking, examples (28) and (29) show how numerical classifiers work, examples (30), (31) and (32) show how possession is marked, example (33) shows how nouns can also be modified by attributive nouns, and examples (34) and (35) show the use of demonstratives.\n\nExample (27) shows a Minangkabau noun that is marked for number. Number is not morphologically marked in Minangkabau, instead numerals precede the noun. Example (27) illustrates this; the noun taun, year, is preceded by the numeral tigo.\n\n(27)\n\nLai tigo taun lebih kurang.\n\nmore three year more less\n\n‘More or less three years ago.’\n\n(Text ID: 979548152848070306)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also marked by numerical classifiers. Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

For example, he suggests that a root like bigay, ‘give’, will specify the conceptual paradigm ‘giving by X of Y to Z’, but will not specify how X, Y and Z’s semantic roles map onto argument structure. The role of voice morphology is then to specify how the semantic roles specified by the root’s conceptual structure ought to be realised syntactically. To do this, the root must first become a verb. So, according to Foley, voice morphology actually performs a single derivational process: deriving a verb from a precategorial root and selecting a specific semantic role as the pivot.\nSince argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, according to Foley (1998; 2008) this means that there is no preference as to which of the participants entailed by the root’s conceptual structure gets realised as the pivot. This, he argues, shows that no one voice type is basic and that voice in Philippine-type languages is ‘symmetrical’ (see Section 2.1). Naturally, precategoriality and symmetrical voice systems are complementary features and it is these features, he argues, that are typologically salient in Philippine-type languages.\nNevertheless, whether Philippine-type languages are precategorial or not is still a matter of debate and a number of alternate analyses have been put forward. Two of these alternate analyses are discussed here. First, we will examine Kroeger’s (1998) argument against precategoriality, and second, we will discuss Himmelmann’s (2006a; 2008) proposal that the morphology of Philippine-type languages is multifunctional.",

A non-core argument, on the other hand, is “peripheral” in the sense that it is not as syntactically ‘available’ as a core argument. Non-core arguments are typically adjunct-like and their non-core status is often marked by the presence of adpositions (Arka, 2003b).\n\nSo, in contrast to the symmetric passive construction, in Standard Indonesian’s asymmetric passive, the actor argument is syntactically demoted and given non-core status (Arka, 2003b; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). This is marked by the presence of the agentive/causal preposition oleh. An example of this can be seen in (6c) where the actor Sul has been given non-core status and is thus preceded by the preposition oleh.\n\nHowever, in the pasif semu, also referred to as the ‘pseudo passive’, the object voice, or passive type two (hereafter the P2 construction), both actor and undergoer are retained as core arguments (Arka and Manning, 2008; Musgrave, 2000).

For example, he suggests that a root like bigay, ‘give’, will specify the conceptual paradigm ‘giving by X of Y to Z’, but will not specify how X, Y and Z’s semantic roles map onto argument structure. The role of voice morphology is then to specify how the semantic roles specified by the root’s conceptual structure ought to be realised syntactically. To do this, the root must first become a verb. So, according to Foley, voice morphology actually performs a single derivational process: deriving a verb from a precategorial root and selecting a specific semantic role as the pivot.\nSince argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, according to Foley (1998; 2008) this means that there is no preference as to which of the participants entailed by the root’s conceptual structure gets realised as the pivot. This, he argues, shows that no one voice type is basic and that voice in Philippine-type languages is ‘symmetrical’ (see Section 2.1). Naturally, precategoriality and symmetrical voice systems are complementary features and it is these features, he argues, that are typologically salient in Philippine-type languages.\nNevertheless, whether Philippine-type languages are precategorial or not is still a matter of debate and a number of alternate analyses have been put forward. Two of these alternate analyses are discussed here.

Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

If we apply Croft’s logic to the Minangkabau case, this would suggest that roots do not have inherent functions. Because nouns and verbs can function in nonprototypical ways without any changes to their surface forms, these roots are not inherently nominal or verbal, some roots are just more likely to occur in nominal or verbal position due to their semantics. If we take this hypothesis to its extreme, a possible conclusion is that Minangkabau roots are precategorial; that is, categories can be defined on the basis of the construction type and lexemes do not have any ‘underlying’ category membership; they acquire nominal or verbal status only when they are used in a nominal or verbal construction.\nSimilar questions have been raised about the categorical status of roots and the role of voice morphology in other Austronesian languages, particularly Philippine-type\n212",

For example a location adjunct can be reassigned core argument status as an undergoer with the use of an applicative. Since this process can occur prior to or independently of other kinds of voice affixation, according to Kroeger (1998), this shows that argument structure, i.e. which participants are assigned core and non-core argument status, is entailed by the verbal root.\nThe second piece of evidence to support the idea that argument structure is specified in the lexicon is that bare verb forms in Blaan select a ‘default’ pivot based on the lexical properties of the verb root. Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds.

Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun].

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

More specifically, the involuntary marker ta- encodes the origin of the action and marks the fact that the action originates spontaneously (see Section 5.2.1), the causative prefix pa- also encodes the origin of the action except to show that the action is instigated by causal mechanisms (see Section 5.2.2), whereas the multifunctional affix ba- shows the development of the action (see Section 5.2.3).\n\nThe active voice prefix maN- also functions as part of this class of lexical/derivational affixes, to show the development of the action, since it has a role in encoding active aktionsart (see Section 5.1.2.3). The applicatives -an and -i, although functioning primarily in the syntactic domain as valency changing devices, also function as part of Minangkabau’s conceptually motivated voice system to show the termination of the action (see Section 5.3). The passive voice marker di- does not belong in this class because its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic. Its status as a morphosyntactic clitic also supports this analysis.\n\n5.2.1 Involuntary ta-\nThe Minangkabau involuntary marker ta- is a reflex of the Proto Malayic affix *tAr(Adelaar, 1992a: 154) and is cognate with the Malay/Indonesian affix ter-. The prefix is used to show an involuntary or spontaneous origin to events in opposition to causatives and passives where a volitional agent is implied. Ta- does not co-occur with any of the other Minangkabau verbal prefixes. However, there is at least one ta- verb that requires the applicative -an to license the correct argument structure: the verb tamandian, ‘to accidentally bathe someone’ (see example (188)).\n\n(188)",

This would indicate that predication really is an inherent, prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that reference is a non-prototypical function.\n\nExamples (52), (53) and (54) illustrate how verbs can be used referentiality with the use of the nominalising affixes -an, pa- and paN-. In (52) the noun tanaman, ‘plant’, is derived from the verb root tanam, ‘to plant’, in combination with the nominalising affix -an. The noun parampok, ‘thief’, in (53) makes use of the agentive nominaliser pa- to derive the form from the verb root rampok, ‘rob, steal’.

The following section describes the Minangkabau applicatives -an and -i: how they operate syntactically and how they show the end point in the ‘evolution of an action’.\n5.3 Applicatives\nMany Austronesian languages have at least one transitivising and/or applicative device (Klamer, 2002: 944). Cross-linguistically, applicatives function as transitivisers. For intransitive verb roots applicatives license an additional argument and for transitive roots they function to increase the transitivity of the verb, or to modify the verb’s argument structure. Applicatives also allow for non-core arguments such as prepositional, indirective, benefactive and instrumental participants, to be included as part of the verb’s core argument structure (Peterson, 2007: 2). Some applicatives also allow comitative and ‘reason’ participants to be raised to core argument status (Sirk, 1996). Furthermore, applicatives may have secondary semantic functions in addition to their valency changing functions, including deriving verbs from nominal sources and marking aspectual notions such as continuous, iterative and intense activity (Klamer, 2000).",

                "content": "To illustrate the multifunctionality of Minangkabau morphology, consider Moussay’s (1998: 254-56) analysis of the Minangkabau prefix ba-. Moussay argues that it can be used to form intransitive verbs with a number of different functions, including a referential function, an existential function and a reflexive function. He also claims that the ba- prefix can combine with an active intransitive root to form a transitive verb which shows a habitual meaning. Unfortunately Moussay does not provide a unified analysis for the ba- prefix nor does he argue why he has presented a multifunctional analysis of the prefix (as opposed to an analysis which treats each use of ba- as a different morpheme).\nMany other verbal affixes in Minangkabau can be analysed as multifunctional. The analysis of the distribution of the various functions of an affix, as well as the motivations behind their selection, impacts directly on how we understand voice and morphosyntax. In this dissertation I discuss the multifunctional uses of ba- as well as other affixes including ta-, pa- and maN-. Based on Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework for understanding voice phenomena, I also seek to provide a unified description of each of these affixes so that their role in Minangkabau’s voice system is made clear (see Chapter 5).\nNow let us examine an example of two Minangkabau morphemes with an overlapping distribution. Examples (1) and (2) show the uses of the two applicatives -an1 and -i. Fortin (2001) argues that -an and -i function primarily as valency changing devices and this is reflected by her glossing of the morphemes as APP, ‘applicative’. Fortin’s translation makes it clear that the applicatives cause significant shifts in meaning to the root garam, ‘salt’, and her analysis also reveals that the -an applicative has a causative meaning whereas the -i applicative adds a locative NP to the core argument structure of the verb.",

                "content": "To illustrate the multifunctionality of Minangkabau morphology, consider Moussay’s (1998: 254-56) analysis of the Minangkabau prefix ba-. Moussay argues that it can be used to form intransitive verbs with a number of different functions, including a referential function, an existential function and a reflexive function. He also claims that the ba- prefix can combine with an active intransitive root to form a transitive verb which shows a habitual meaning. Unfortunately Moussay does not provide a unified analysis for the ba- prefix nor does he argue why he has presented a multifunctional analysis of the prefix (as opposed to an analysis which treats each use of ba- as a different morpheme).\nMany other verbal affixes in Minangkabau can be analysed as multifunctional. The analysis of the distribution of the various functions of an affix, as well as the motivations behind their selection, impacts directly on how we understand voice and morphosyntax. In this dissertation I discuss the multifunctional uses of ba- as well as other affixes including ta-, pa- and maN-. Based on Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework for understanding voice phenomena, I also seek to provide a unified description of each of these affixes so that their role in Minangkabau’s voice system is made clear (see Chapter 5).\nNow let us examine an example of two Minangkabau morphemes with an overlapping distribution. Examples (1) and (2) show the uses of the two applicatives -an1 and -i. Fortin (2001) argues that -an and -i function primarily as valency changing devices and this is reflected by her glossing of the morphemes as APP, ‘applicative’. Fortin’s translation makes it clear that the applicatives cause significant shifts in meaning to the root garam, ‘salt’, and her analysis also reveals that the -an applicative has a causative meaning whereas the -i applicative adds a locative NP to the core argument structure of the verb.",

However, for nominal roots, different voice affixes on the same root create forms that range greatly in meaning.\n\nPrecategorial languages must be both bidirectional and compositional, i.e. any substantive root must be able to function in any available syntactic slot and any morphological devices must have the same effects on all roots (cf. Evans and Osada, 2005). Therefore, Kroeger’s (1998) evidence that the effects of voice affixation on nominal roots are unpredictable provides the most convincing argument to support the idea that there is indeed a lexical distinction between nominal and verbal roots in Philippine-type languages.",

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-.

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf.

Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

The predicate construction is represented in (39) and described in further detail in Section 4.3.\n(39) Predicate Construction =\n((NP) → (negator) → (TAM) → (voice marking)-PRED-(applicative) → (adverb) → (NP))\nMinangkabau verbs also display many of the formal properties of verbs described by Anderson (1985). These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes. Table 10 lists each of these formal properties of verbs and describes how these properties are realised in Minangkabau.\n67\n\n\fTable 10.

However, he argues that the aspectual distinctions are a result of some clauses being foregrounding, i.e. they are central to the development of the narrative and are perfective, and some clauses being backgrounding, i.e. they provide information that supports, but is not central to, the main events of the narrative and are imperfective. He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.",

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-. Foregrounding clauses were also more likely to be perfective, and backgrounding clauses to be imperfective.

In (11) we see an example of active voice used in a clause containing background information.

It was argued that this class of lexical/derivational devices function to show a conceptually motivated system of voice oppositions and that this voice system can be usefully described in terms of Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework. Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language.

These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point. Thus voice marking encodes how the action originates “origin of action”, how the action progresses “development of action”, and how and where the action ends “termination of action” (Shibatani, 2006). For example, transitive actions typically end in the patient being affected, however in some events, the action terminates at a third entity, perhaps a recipient or a benefactor, thus the focus is on the end point of the action. If voice marking encodes this kind of situation type then it can be said to show the “termination of action”. Types of voice marking that fall into this category include benefactives, malefactives and applicatives (Shibatani, 2006: 240). Other types of voice marking used to encode distinctions at each point in the “evolution of action” are listed in Table 16.\n\nTable 16.

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

They function primarily to show pragmatic emphasis, to establish politeness and solidarity, and to aid the flow of information from the “private world” of the speaker into the “shared world” of collaborative discourse (Schourup, 1983; 1999).

Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

This is a non-prototypical function for these parts of speech. A number of other parts of speech can also function to predicate in Minangkabau, as will be discussed in Section 4.3.1.\n81",

These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point. Thus voice marking encodes how the action originates “origin of action”, how the action progresses “development of action”, and how and where the action ends “termination of action” (Shibatani, 2006). For example, transitive actions typically end in the patient being affected, however in some events, the action terminates at a third entity, perhaps a recipient or a benefactor, thus the focus is on the end point of the action. If voice marking encodes this kind of situation type then it can be said to show the “termination of action”. Types of voice marking that fall into this category include benefactives, malefactives and applicatives (Shibatani, 2006: 240). Other types of voice marking used to encode distinctions at each point in the “evolution of action” are listed in Table 16.\n\nTable 16. Types of conceptual voice marking.\n\n(Shibatani, 2006)\n\nEVOLUTION OF ACTION 1. Origin of an action:\n2. Development of an action:\n3. Termination of an action:",

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Ditransitive verb roots, on the other hand, license a third argument which can be assigned core argument status in a ‘dative’ construction. Non-core arguments can also be assigned core status, and thus become available to be selected as the pivot, with the use of the general applicative -an or the locative applicative -i (see Section 5.3).\n\nTo demonstrate how the core/non-core distinction has an effect on which argument can be selected as the pivot, consider the two verbs agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’. The verb agiah is ditransitive so specifies three arguments as part of its underlying argument structure: an actor, an undergoer and a recipient. However, buek is transitive so only specifies two arguments: an actor and an undergoer, but the use of the applicative -an licenses an additional benefactor participant.\n\nExamples (129) and (130) show the use of these two verbs, agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’, respectively. In (129b) the recipient argument, inyo, ‘him’, (which is marked in bold), is assigned core argument status. This means that it can appear unmarked, i.e. without the preposition ka, in post-verbal position. This also means that if agiah, ‘give’, is marked for passive voice, both the undergoer pitih, ‘money’, and the recipient inyo, ‘him’, are available to be selected as the pivot (see (129c) and (129d)).\n\n(129) a.\n\nAli maagiah pitih ka\nAli AV-give money to\n‘Ali gave money to him.’\n\ninyo.\n3\n\nb.

These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point.

However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988). An example of this construction can be found in (19).\n\n(19) a.\n\nGopnyan ka geu=côm lôn.\n\nshe\n\nalready 3-kiss\n\nI\n\n‘She (already) kissed me.’\n\nb.

In ditransitive active voice constructions it allows for recipient and benefactor participants to be promoted to core argument status. The applicative also allows for benefactive, but not recipient participants, to be realised as the undergoer pivot in passive voice constructions.\nThe -an applicative also has some secondary semantic functions. It can be seen to act as a causative marker when deriving transitive verbs from stative verb roots. It also has some aspectual properties, adding completive aspect to activity verbs. These semantic properties are a ‘side effect’ of -an’s role in showing the evolution of the action. Since -an functions to show the termination point of an event, it marks the degree of affectedness of the undergoer.

Note that -an can occur on stative roots to derive transitive verbs without the need for maNprefixation as (231c) shows. Note also that although the affixation of maN- derives an intransitive change of state verbs from stative roots (see Section 5.1.2.3), the form *manyakik does not exist.\n170\n\n\f(231) a. b. c.\n\nMeja tu\n\ntasipak dek Silvie jadi sakik kakinyo.",

Some Austronesian voice markers also have aspectual qualities which may be linked with their role in showing semantic and conceptual notions (cf. Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

The other participants in the clause are marked by articles that show their semantic role; for example the benefactor bata, ‘child’, is marked by the benefactive composite para sa and so on.\nSentences (5b), (5c) and (5d) show the three other Tagalog voice types. In (5b) the verb is marked for goal voice, meaning that the goal bigas, ‘rice’, is the pivot.

This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6). Thus, voice marking in Philippine-type languages also has a verbal derivational function.\n2.2 Indonesian-type Voice",

These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point. Thus voice marking encodes how the action originates “origin of action”, how the action progresses “development of action”, and how and where the action ends “termination of action” (Shibatani, 2006). For example, transitive actions typically end in the patient being affected, however in some events, the action terminates at a third entity, perhaps a recipient or a benefactor, thus the focus is on the end point of the action. If voice marking encodes this kind of situation type then it can be said to show the “termination of action”. Types of voice marking that fall into this category include benefactives, malefactives and applicatives (Shibatani, 2006: 240). Other types of voice marking used to encode distinctions at each point in the “evolution of action” are listed in Table 16.\n\nTable 16.

This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

Kroeger (1998) argues that pivot choice is determined by morphosyntax but that a pre-ordained argument structure also influences speakers’ preference for pivot selection. He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

Notice that the verb is marked by both the proclitic ji, which is co-referential with the (null) agent, and the enclitic geuh, which is coreferential with the undergoer, gopnyan, ‘he’. In Acehnese transitive verbs, the agents are compulsorily referenced by proclitics whereas undergoers are only optionally referenced by enclitics. The presence of undergoer enclitics implies that the undergoer is topical therefore it is rare to have a undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is topical (Durie, 1985a: 201-06). In example (15) the undergoer is indeed topical since the agent is not overtly expressed. Notice also that the undergoer appears before the verb. The ability to appear in pre-verbal position is a property of Core Topics in Acehnese (see below).\n\nSince both active and stative verbs can be either agent oriented or undergoer oriented, Durie (1985a) argues that the split between agent oriented verbs and undergoer oriented verbs is instead defined according to the semantic notions of control and de-control. If a verb takes an agent, the ultimate initiator of the event, it is a controlled verb, whereas if a verb takes an undergoer, the participant that is ultimately affected by the event, then it is a de-controlled verb (Durie, 1985a: 55-56). Table 4 shows some examples of agent oriented (i.e. controlled) verbs and undergoer oriented (i.e. de-controlled) verbs. Notice that both the controlled and de-controlled categories include verbs which are semantically active and verbs which are semantically stative.\n\n32\n\n\fTable 4.

Notice that the verb is marked by both the proclitic ji, which is co-referential with the (null) agent, and the enclitic geuh, which is coreferential with the undergoer, gopnyan, ‘he’. In Acehnese transitive verbs, the agents are compulsorily referenced by proclitics whereas undergoers are only optionally referenced by enclitics. The presence of undergoer enclitics implies that the undergoer is topical therefore it is rare to have a undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is topical (Durie, 1985a: 201-06).

However, he argues that the aspectual distinctions are a result of some clauses being foregrounding, i.e. they are central to the development of the narrative and are perfective, and some clauses being backgrounding, i.e. they provide information that supports, but is not central to, the main events of the narrative and are imperfective. He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.",

He further explains that the roots must take on nominal or verbal properties according to the construction in which they are used. He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

The following section describes the Minangkabau applicatives -an and -i: how they operate syntactically and how they show the end point in the ‘evolution of an action’.\n5.3 Applicatives\nMany Austronesian languages have at least one transitivising and/or applicative device (Klamer, 2002: 944). Cross-linguistically, applicatives function as transitivisers. For intransitive verb roots applicatives license an additional argument and for transitive roots they function to increase the transitivity of the verb, or to modify the verb’s argument structure. Applicatives also allow for non-core arguments such as prepositional, indirective, benefactive and instrumental participants, to be included as part of the verb’s core argument structure (Peterson, 2007: 2). Some applicatives also allow comitative and ‘reason’ participants to be raised to core argument status (Sirk, 1996). Furthermore, applicatives may have secondary semantic functions in addition to their valency changing functions, including deriving verbs from nominal sources and marking aspectual notions such as continuous, iterative and intense activity (Klamer, 2000).",

It was argued that this class of lexical/derivational devices function to show a conceptually motivated system of voice oppositions and that this voice system can be usefully described in terms of Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework. Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

These middle predicates are intransitive but it is clear that the actor also undergoes some change, so in this sense they are broadly reflexive. Middle voice in Minangkabau resembles the middle voice of Greek which is used to mark transitive predicates that are somewhere between an active and a passive, or intransitive predicates that have a passive like relation to their subject (Bakker, 1994). In fact, the reflexive and reciprocal predicates can also be described as middle constructions since the action does not extend beyond the sphere of the actor. According to Croft’s (1991; 1994) event-based framework for voice phenomena, reflexives and reciprocals have the same event frame as middle verbs since they involve a situation in which the subject is both the initiator and end point of the action.\n\nCross-linguistically, the middle voice is associated with a number of situation types that involve similar aktionsart and event properties. Based on Talmy’s (1972) classification of event types, Kemmer (1994: 181-83) lists ten middle situation types that might involve middle marking in languages that have a middle voice.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

In (5c) the direction is the pivot therefore the verb is marked for locative voice, and in (5d) the benefactor is pivot therefore the verb is marked for benefactive voice.\nAn additional typologically salient feature of Philippine-type voice systems is that they are symmetrical (Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2005; 2008). This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6). Thus, voice marking in Philippine-type languages also has a verbal derivational function.\n2.2 Indonesian-type Voice",

These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point. Thus voice marking encodes how the action originates “origin of action”, how the action progresses “development of action”, and how and where the action ends “termination of action” (Shibatani, 2006). For example, transitive actions typically end in the patient being affected, however in some events, the action terminates at a third entity, perhaps a recipient or a benefactor, thus the focus is on the end point of the action. If voice marking encodes this kind of situation type then it can be said to show the “termination of action”. Types of voice marking that fall into this category include benefactives, malefactives and applicatives (Shibatani, 2006: 240). Other types of voice marking used to encode distinctions at each point in the “evolution of action” are listed in Table 16.\n\nTable 16.

For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

                "content": "Chapter 5 describes the Minangkabau system of voice and verbal morphology. In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

The affix derives middle verbs from nouns as demonstrated in (59) and (60) (please also see Chapter 5).\n\n(59)\n\nBasuami jo urang Lampuang.\n\nMID-husband with person Lampung\n\n‘She married a man from Lampung.’\n\n(Text ID: 337497105305200306)\n\n(60)\n\nSi Emi basakolah, si Roni sagalo si Ann lai ado rumah.\n\nPERS Emi MID-school PERS Roni all\n\nPERS Ann more exist house\n\n‘Emi went to school, so did Roni, all of them did, but Ann stayed at home.’\n\n(Text ID: 562203133739080306)\n\nVerbal predicates can also be derived from nominals with the use of the active voice prefix maN-. For example, in (61) the verb mancarito-carito, ‘tell a story’, has been derived from the NP carito, ‘story,’ (see Section 6.3.1.3 for more examples of active verbs derived from nominals).\n\n(61)\n\nE ado mancarito-carito jo ambo.\n\nFILL exist AV-RED-story\n\nwith 1sg\n\n‘Somebody told me the story.’\n\n(Text ID: 157057083427161106)\n\nUnmarked nominals can be predicative even when a marked alternative exists. For example, in (62) notice that the unmarked form namo, ‘name’, functions predicatively in the same way as the marked form banamo.\n\n(62) a.\n\nNamo nyo Ana.\nname 3 Ana\n‘She is called Ana.’\n\n83\n\n\fb. Banamo nyo Ana.\nMID-name 3 Ana\n‘She is called Ana.’ (Elicitation)\n4.3.1.2 Numeral Predicates\nMinangkabau also has numeral predicates. Numeral predicates, like some nominal predicates, are attributive. In (63) the numeral head duo, ‘two’, modifies the argument anak den, ‘my children’.\n\n(63)\n\nAnak den duo.\n\nchild 1sg two\n\n‘I have two children .’\n\n[Literally: ‘my children are two in number.’]\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAlso like nominal predicates, numeral predicates can be preceded by TAM adverbials.

The noun parampok, ‘thief’, in (53) makes use of the agentive nominaliser pa- to derive the form from the verb root rampok, ‘rob, steal’.

In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates.

For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah.

Since verbs describe events that occur over a period of time they must have sequential scanning.\nBut what of languages like Minangkabau, that appear not to have a class of adjectives? Minangkabau has a distinct class of stative verbs. Notions encoded as adjectives in languages like English, in Minangkabau belong instead to this class of stative verbs. Even languages like English which have a class of stative verbs distinct from adjectives are problematic. Since stative verbs are telic and involve no change over time, according to Langacker’s (1987b) framework, they must involve summary scanning. This then provides no way of distinguishing between conceptualisations of stative verbs and adjectives. Does this then mean that adjectives and states are the same thing? Or that states are just non-prototypical verbs? Or indeed that states are non-prototypical adjectives? These questions suggest that the solutions may be language-specific (see Section 4.1.3.2).\nThere are a number important ideas raised by Langacker’s (1987a; 1987b) framework of parts of speech that I draw on in my analysis of categories in Minangkabau. First, categorisations of parts of speech ought to be in part based on the way humans perceive and conceptualise objects, events and qualities. Second, there are prototypical and nonprototypical instantiations of parts of speech. And third, where categories can function in a number of non-prototypical ways, it is useful to think of the properties of the construction as a whole to differentiate one instantiation of the category from another.\n4.1.3.2 Croft",

He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds.

So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure.

For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun].

This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6).

He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model.

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’.

These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes. Table 10 lists each of these formal properties of verbs and describes how these properties are realised in Minangkabau.\n67\n\n\fTable 10.

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Minangkabau also has a class of property words that function both attributively and predicatively. Since neither one of these functions is marked we cannot argue that either one of these functions is inherent and the other derived. When property words function predicatively their syntactic and morphological features resemble those of stative verbs, but with two exceptions. The first is that property words are gradable whereas states are not. The second is that emotion property words have special syntactic valence whereas states are without exception intransitive. However, the similarities between property words and stative verbs is such that rather than assign property words a separate category in Minangkabau, it is better to think of them as special kinds of gradable stative verbs. Drawing on Langacker’s (1987b) framework of parts of speech, we can characterise true stative verbs as having polar relationality and stative verbs denoting properties as having scalar relationality.",

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254).

Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice.

Clauses with di- marked verbs, on the other hand, were\n26\n\n\findicative, eventive, and on the timeline of the main narrative events. These clauses were also more likely to have referential patients that were individuated, animate, and that had continuous mention throughout the text (Wouk, 1989: 132-40).",

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity.

Non-core arguments can also be assigned core status, and thus become available to be selected as the pivot, with the use of the general applicative -an or the locative applicative -i (see Section 5.3).\n\nTo demonstrate how the core/non-core distinction has an effect on which argument can be selected as the pivot, consider the two verbs agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’. The verb agiah is ditransitive so specifies three arguments as part of its underlying argument structure: an actor, an undergoer and a recipient. However, buek is transitive so only specifies two arguments: an actor and an undergoer, but the use of the applicative -an licenses an additional benefactor participant.\n\nExamples (129) and (130) show the use of these two verbs, agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’, respectively. In (129b) the recipient argument, inyo, ‘him’, (which is marked in bold), is assigned core argument status. This means that it can appear unmarked, i.e. without the preposition ka, in post-verbal position. This also means that if agiah, ‘give’, is marked for passive voice, both the undergoer pitih, ‘money’, and the recipient inyo, ‘him’, are available to be selected as the pivot (see (129c) and (129d)).\n\n(129) a.\n\nAli maagiah pitih ka\nAli AV-give money to\n‘Ali gave money to him.’\n\ninyo.\n3\n\nb.

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

An example of this can be seen in (6c) where the actor Sul has been given non-core status and is thus preceded by the preposition oleh.\n\nHowever, in the pasif semu, also referred to as the ‘pseudo passive’, the object voice, or passive type two (hereafter the P2 construction), both actor and undergoer are retained as core arguments (Arka and Manning, 2008; Musgrave, 2000). In the P2 construction, the undergoer is selected as the pivot (cf. Chung, 1976a) and precedes the verb. The P2 verb is not marked for voice but hosts a pronominal proclitic coding the actor. The sentence in (7) shows an example of a P2 construction. In this example notice that the undergoer buku ini, ‘this book’, is the pivot and thus precedes the verb, baca, ‘read’. The first person actor, ku, then appears as a proclitic on the verb.\n\n(7)\n\nBuku ini\n\nsudah ku=baca.\n\nbook DEM:prox PFCT 1sg=read\n\n‘I have read this book.’\n\n(adapted from Sneddon, 1996: 249)",

He argues that a Core Role is a participant licensed by the\n34\n\n\fverb’s argument structure that is syntactically ‘available’. Core Roles are more syntactically privileged than adjunct NPs, which can be identified by prepositional marking. Only agents, undergoers and datives can be Core Roles.\n\nDurie (1985a: 191) also argues for the existence of a ‘Core Topic’. The Core Topic has a similar pragmatic function to the English subject in that it is refers to a referentially salient participant. However, unlike the English subject, no participant is underlyingly selected as the Core Topic therefore any one of the Core Roles in a clause may be selected. Also unlike the English subject, Core Topics are not obligatory therefore it is possible for clauses to have no overt Core Topic.\n\nCore Topics have a syntactic effect in that the Core Topic must occupy pre-verbal position. However, the selection of agent or undergoer as Core Topic has no effect on pronominal clitic marking on the verb except that it is rare for there to be undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is selected as the Core Topic (see example (15)). When the undergoer is selected as the Core Topic, the agent argument occurs in post-verbal position and is marked by the preposition lé (Durie, 1988). An example of this construction can be found in (19).\n\n(19) a.\n\nGopnyan ka geu=côm lôn.\n\nshe\n\nalready 3-kiss\n\nI\n\n‘She (already) kissed me.’\n\nb.

Ditransitive verb roots, on the other hand, license a third argument which can be assigned core argument status in a ‘dative’ construction. Non-core arguments can also be assigned core status, and thus become available to be selected as the pivot, with the use of the general applicative -an or the locative applicative -i (see Section 5.3).\n\nTo demonstrate how the core/non-core distinction has an effect on which argument can be selected as the pivot, consider the two verbs agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’. The verb agiah is ditransitive so specifies three arguments as part of its underlying argument structure: an actor, an undergoer and a recipient. However, buek is transitive so only specifies two arguments: an actor and an undergoer, but the use of the applicative -an licenses an additional benefactor participant.\n\nExamples (129) and (130) show the use of these two verbs, agiah, ‘give’, and buek, ‘make’, respectively. In (129b) the recipient argument, inyo, ‘him’, (which is marked in bold), is assigned core argument status. This means that it can appear unmarked, i.e. without the preposition ka, in post-verbal position. This also means that if agiah, ‘give’, is marked for passive voice, both the undergoer pitih, ‘money’, and the recipient inyo, ‘him’, are available to be selected as the pivot (see (129c) and (129d)).\n\n(129) a.\n\nAli maagiah pitih ka\nAli AV-give money to\n‘Ali gave money to him.’\n\ninyo.\n3\n\nb.

However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1.

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures.

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254).

Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

However, he argues that the aspectual distinctions are a result of some clauses being foregrounding, i.e. they are central to the development of the narrative and are perfective, and some clauses being backgrounding, i.e. they provide information that supports, but is not central to, the main events of the narrative and are imperfective. He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.",

Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4).

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence.

In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives.

In Acehnese transitive verbs, the agents are compulsorily referenced by proclitics whereas undergoers are only optionally referenced by enclitics. The presence of undergoer enclitics implies that the undergoer is topical therefore it is rare to have a undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is topical (Durie, 1985a: 201-06). In example (15) the undergoer is indeed topical since the agent is not overtly expressed. Notice also that the undergoer appears before the verb.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds.

Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

A bare verb root can only then be assigned active semantics. These facts suggest that active voice marking is not obligatory and that active voice is basic, which is also the case in Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b).\nThe evidence presented in Section 6.1.2.2 also suggests that since bare verbs can also be given a passive reading, that passive voice marking is not obligatory either. The most common place to find a bare passive verb is in a construction that resembles the syntactised passive voice construction: ‘pre-verbal undergoer + di-verb + dek + actor’. Because this construction is so highly marked, perhaps the di- marking on the verb becomes redundant and is therefore not obligatory. However, examples (260), (261), (262), (263), (264) and (265) showed that even sentences that do not adhere to this highly syntactised pattern can be given passive interpretations. One would think then, that passive and active voice marking is only obligatory when semantic roles require disambiguation.

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254).

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

In passive clauses, the undergoer is conceptually salient and highly referential. According to Hopper and Thompson, this suggests that the undergoer is highly individuated, which in turn also means that the clause is high in transitivity. Another feature of clauses high in transitivity is that they are associated with telic aspect due to the degree of affectedness of the undergoer. Thus di- clauses in Minangkabau can be given a telic reading not because aspectual marking is a direct property of di-, but because di- clauses are high in transitivity.\n5.1.4 The Pasif Semu\nIn Standard Minangkabau, there is another kind of passive voice construction called the pasif semu (henceforth the P2 construction). Like a di- passive, the undergoer in a P2 construction performs the pivot function. However, unlike a di- passive, the actor in a P2 construction retains its status as a core argument. The P2 verb is unmarked yet the construction remains distinctive from a bare active construction because of the word order constraints it exhibits. However, due to the high frequency of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau, the P2 is not a distinctive construction in this variety (see Section 3.3 and Section 6.1.2.4).",

According to Hopper and Thompson, this suggests that the undergoer is highly individuated, which in turn also means that the clause is high in transitivity. Another feature of clauses high in transitivity is that they are associated with telic aspect due to the degree of affectedness of the undergoer. Thus di- clauses in Minangkabau can be given a telic reading not because aspectual marking is a direct property of di-, but because di- clauses are high in transitivity.\n5.1.4 The Pasif Semu\nIn Standard Minangkabau, there is another kind of passive voice construction called the pasif semu (henceforth the P2 construction). Like a di- passive, the undergoer in a P2 construction performs the pivot function. However, unlike a di- passive, the actor in a P2 construction retains its status as a core argument. The P2 verb is unmarked yet the construction remains distinctive from a bare active construction because of the word order constraints it exhibits. However, due to the high frequency of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau, the P2 is not a distinctive construction in this variety (see Section 3.3 and Section 6.1.2.4).",

It was argued that this class of lexical/derivational devices function to show a conceptually motivated system of voice oppositions and that this voice system can be usefully described in terms of Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework. Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity. Clauses with N- marked verbs were irrealis, stative, off the timeline of the main narrative events, and more likely to have non-referential patients. Clauses with di- marked verbs, on the other hand, were\n26\n\n\findicative, eventive, and on the timeline of the main narrative events. These clauses were also more likely to have referential patients that were individuated, animate, and that had continuous mention throughout the text (Wouk, 1989: 132-40).",

These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point. Thus voice marking encodes how the action originates “origin of action”, how the action progresses “development of action”, and how and where the action ends “termination of action” (Shibatani, 2006). For example, transitive actions typically end in the patient being affected, however in some events, the action terminates at a third entity, perhaps a recipient or a benefactor, thus the focus is on the end point of the action. If voice marking encodes this kind of situation type then it can be said to show the “termination of action”. Types of voice marking that fall into this category include benefactives, malefactives and applicatives (Shibatani, 2006: 240).

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

However, the uses of maN- with verbal roots are predictable whereas the semantics of maN- verbs derived from nominal roots are quite difficult to predict. The examples in (288) demonstrate this. Although the derived verbal forms all share active semantics, the conceptual framework for each of the events is quite different. First, the transitivity of derived verbal forms is not predictable. For example, (288d) is intransitive whereas the other verbs are transitive. This indicates that some elements of the argument structure of nominal roots are specified in the lexicon. One can also not predict what kind of activity the nominal root entails. According to Moussay (1998) maN- derives verbs meaning ‘to use noun’ from nominal roots. The verb manggandang, ‘beat on the drum’, is clearly an example of this type. In addition, Adelaar (1992a) finds that nouns can also form intransitive maN- verbs meaning ‘to be on noun’. Based on the examples in (288) we can also add ‘to send noun to someone’ (manesemes), ‘to put noun on something’ (mancat), and ‘to make noun’ (manggulai), to the list. Examples of each of these verbs predicating in a sentence can be found in (289), (290), (291), and (292).\n220",

These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point. Thus voice marking encodes how the action originates “origin of action”, how the action progresses “development of action”, and how and where the action ends “termination of action” (Shibatani, 2006). For example, transitive actions typically end in the patient being affected, however in some events, the action terminates at a third entity, perhaps a recipient or a benefactor, thus the focus is on the end point of the action. If voice marking encodes this kind of situation type then it can be said to show the “termination of action”. Types of voice marking that fall into this category include benefactives, malefactives and applicatives (Shibatani, 2006: 240). Other types of voice marking used to encode distinctions at each point in the “evolution of action” are listed in Table 16.\n\nTable 16.

He explains that most experiencer verbs in Blaan select the experiencer as pivot in their basic form, however other experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘hear’) select the stimulus as their ‘default’ pivot and some (e.g. ‘see’, ‘smell’) even select the instrument. It does not follow from the semantics of the class of experiencer verbs that stimuli or instruments be the basic pivot choice for only some verbs, therefore he concludes that the specifications for the ‘default’ pivot must be stipulated in the lexicon.",

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

However, he argues that the aspectual distinctions are a result of some clauses being foregrounding, i.e. they are central to the development of the narrative and are perfective, and some clauses being backgrounding, i.e. they provide information that supports, but is not central to, the main events of the narrative and are imperfective. He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.",

Foregrounded clauses are typically realis and are associated with perfective or telic aspect.\nHopper and Thompson (1980) also argue that passive clauses are associated with telic aspect. In passive clauses, the undergoer is conceptually salient and highly referential. According to Hopper and Thompson, this suggests that the undergoer is highly individuated, which in turn also means that the clause is high in transitivity. Another feature of clauses high in transitivity is that they are associated with telic aspect due to the degree of affectedness of the undergoer. Thus di- clauses in Minangkabau can be given a telic reading not because aspectual marking is a direct property of di-, but because di- clauses are high in transitivity.\n5.1.4 The Pasif Semu\nIn Standard Minangkabau, there is another kind of passive voice construction called the pasif semu (henceforth the P2 construction). Like a di- passive, the undergoer in a P2 construction performs the pivot function. However, unlike a di- passive, the actor in a P2 construction retains its status as a core argument. The P2 verb is unmarked yet the construction remains distinctive from a bare active construction because of the word order constraints it exhibits. However, due to the high frequency of bare verbs and the flexible word order constraints of Colloquial Minangkabau, the P2 is not a distinctive construction in this variety (see Section 3.3 and Section 6.1.2.4).",

Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Nouns are also marked for definiteness and deictic status by demonstratives. In terms of the relational properties of nouns, which reflect their syntactic function as described by Andrews (1985), Minangkabau nouns which perform non-core grammatical relations, such as benefactors, instruments, recipients, locations and comitative participants, are marked by specific prepositions. Nouns with core argument status are unmarked but their grammatical relation is determined by their relative position in the clause or by their referential status. In Minangkabau there is no ‘genitive case’ as possession is not marked morphologically. Instead the possessor is encoded as a nominal or pronominal modifier that follows the possessed noun. Minangkabau does not have nominal\n6 Reduplicative morphology derives “verbal aspects (such as ‘iterative’, ‘repetitive’, ‘durative’, ‘continue to be’)” in many Austronesian languages (Klamer, 2002: 938).\n61",

First, there are no clear nominalising processes in Philippine-type languages. All affixes that are used to derive nominal forms can also be used as voice marking affixes, therefore there are no unique nominalising affixes. In addition to this, inflected verb forms can also function as NP heads without any change to their morphological marking. Second, Foley argues that roots do not have an underlying argument structure. If this is the case then this means there is nothing at the lexical level to differentiate verbs from nouns.\n213",

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

So, Wouk (1989: 233-34; 1996: 366; 2004a) argues that the relative saliency of actor and patient arguments “as mediated through theme and topic” also motivates the choice of voice morphology. As Wouk (1996: 381) defines it, a “theme” is a “referent that is the focus of attention”. It is a referent that has a high frequency of mentions throughout a text and is most often a pronoun or zero anaphora. A topic, on the other hand, is essentially “what a text or segment of text is about. [It] need not be an individual entity; it may also be a class or concept”. Topics can be identified by continuity of mention (Wouk, 1996: 382).

The choice of the passive voice marker di- in A1, A2 and A4 is triggered by the thematicity and topicality of the patient participant.

The high discourse relevance of the argument is reflected morphologically in that it triggers corresponding verbal marking, and syntactically by the fact that it has control over a number of restricted syntactic constructions. Thus in pragmatically motivated voice systems the notion of discourse relevance has been grammaticalised.\n104",

So, Wouk (1989: 233-34; 1996: 366; 2004a) argues that the relative saliency of actor and patient arguments “as mediated through theme and topic” also motivates the choice of voice morphology. As Wouk (1996: 381) defines it, a “theme” is a “referent that is the focus of attention”. It is a referent that has a high frequency of mentions throughout a text and is most often a pronoun or zero anaphora. A topic, on the other hand, is essentially “what a text or segment of text is about. [It] need not be an individual entity; it may also be a class or concept”. Topics can be identified by continuity of mention (Wouk, 1996: 382). So di- clauses are used when the patient participant is thematic and/or topical, and N- clauses are used when the actor participant is thematic and/or topical.\n\nFor example, consider the SJI dialogue presented in (8). The choice of the passive voice marker di- in A1, A2 and A4 is triggered by the thematicity and topicality of the patient participant. The thematic referent, i.e. the patient, is the person telling the story, participant A, who is recounting meeting her new boyfriend’s parents. The patient is not overtly expressed in A’s first and second utterances but it is understood to refer to the speaker and to be thematic. Notice that the verbs dianggap, ‘consider’, and dikenalkenalin, ‘introduce’, are marked for passive voice by di-. This is because even though it is not overtly expressed, the patient is the most referentially salient participant.\n\n(8) A1: Heeh, udah dianggap anak nih.\nuhuh, already DI-consider child this\n‘uhuh, they consider (me) their child.’\n\nB1: Oh ya.\n\nA2: Udah dikenal-kenalin ke keluarganya.\n\nalready DI-know-in\n\nto family-GEN\n\n‘They’ve introduced (me) to their family.’\n\nB2: Hm.\n\n27",

For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds.

So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions.

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

It was argued that this class of lexical/derivational devices function to show a conceptually motivated system of voice oppositions and that this voice system can be usefully described in terms of Shibatani’s (2006) “evolution of action” framework. Thus ta- and pa- show the origin of the action, ba- and maN- show the development of the action, and the applicatives -an and -i show the end point of the action. Chapter 5 also suggested that the passive voice marker didoes not operate within this conceptually motivated voice system. This idea is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic and that its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic.\nChapter 6 then showed that bare verbs, i.e. verbs that are not marked for voice, are a pervasive feature of Colloquial Minangkabau. It was argued that the existence of bare verbs implies that voice morphology is not obligatory in this variety and that the morphological underspecification of bare verbs leads to indeterminacy in assigning semantic roles to the verb’s arguments. It was suggested that Colloquial Minangkabau can be described as an ‘Associational’ language (Gil, 2001; 2007), meaning that the language allows for a wide range of possible interpretations of an utterance to be available. This explains how the underspecification of elements in an utterance created by the existence of bare verbs is acceptable to speakers of Minangkabau.\nChapter 6 also revealed that bare verbs and bare nominals are multifunctional. It was noted that the morphological underspecification of these multifunctional verbal and nominal roots might imply that there is no underlying categorical distinction between them. However, Chapter 6 argued against a precategorial analysis for Minangkabau and concluded that there is a lexical distinction between nouns and verbs.",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

In cases where di- cliticises with a vowel initial stem that has a glottal stop onset, the glottal stop will be preserved and the [i] vowel in di- will not merge with the initial vowel of the stem. However, di- cannot stand alone as a prosodic word and must ‘lean on’ adjacent words. This means that disatisfies Anderson’s (2005: 23) definition of a phonological clitic: “a linguistic element whose phonological form is deficient in that it lacks prosodic structure at the level of the (prosodic) word”.\nThe passive voice marker di- is also restricted in terms of which class of substantive word it may cliticise with since it only cliticises with bi-valent verbs. Di- may also only occur in a certain specific syntactic frame, i.e., a passive clause. This makes di- a ‘special clitic’, according to Zwicky’s (1977) terminology, and ‘morphosyntactic clitic’ according to Anderson (2005: 31).

Hopper found that in Classical Malay, clauses containing di- marked verbs were perfective, realis, active and used to encode foregrounded events, which are central to the progression of the narrative. Clauses containing meN- verbs on the other hand were imperfective, often irrealis and frequently found in backgrounded clauses.\nSimilarly, a recent study of contemporary Malay meN-, also found that the prefix was associated with imperfective and progressive aspect (Soh and Nomoto, 2008). Furthermore, in her study of Chindo, a variety of Non-Standard Indonesian spoken by the Peranakan Chinese community in Malang, East Java, Rafferty (1982) argues that the homorganic nasal prefix N-, traditionally thought of as encoding active voice, functions primarily as a marker of imperfective aspect. The passive voice marker di- conversely has the function of marking perfective aspect in this variety (see Section 2.2).\nNone of these studies claims that meN- or N- encodes imperfective aspect but it is clear that the use of the active voice prefix correlates closely with clauses that display these imperfective aspectual qualities. The fact that Minangkabau maN- has similar aspectual qualities is a result of its role in showing the development of action.\n5.1.3 Passive Voice\nTo complete our understanding of Minangkabau’s pragmatically motivated voice system now let us discuss the phonological, syntactic and semantic effects of the passive voice marker di-.\n5.1.3.1 Phonological Properties of di-\nIn Minangkabau, passive voice is encoded by the morpheme di-. The Minangkabau passive voice marker is cognate with Malay/Indonesian di-, which is described as a prefix (Dardjowidjojo, 1978; Musgrave, 2000; Sneddon, 1996). However, di- does not behave like a prefix in Minangkabau. Williams (1961: 66-67) labels the Minangkabau passive voice marker di- a “quasi prefix” but I argue that it is a proclitic. Evidence\n132",

Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes.

In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’.

Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Gil (2000) argues that there is indeterminacy about category membership in Malay/Indonesian, particularly in non-standard regional varieties of the languages. Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

First, the characterisation of voice relies heavily on the nature of grammatical relations in the language. Second, in addition to the syntactic processes that motivate voice, it is also essential to consider the motivating discourse/pragmatic factors involved. Third, as well as encoding syntactic distinctions, voice marking may also encode semantic and conceptual distinctions such as aspectual notions. This third issue is especially important to consider for pivotless languages like Acehnese, since ‘voice’ marking does not encode grammatical relations in this kind of language. These theoretical themes also heavily inform my characterisation of the syntactic, discourse/pragmatic, and semantic properties of voice in Minangkabau (see Chapter 5).\n40\n\n\f41",

In Minangkabau these questions exist because of the use of bare forms, whereas in Philippine-type languages it is the prevalent use of voice morphology with a range of non-verbal parts of speech that causes the conundrum. This had led some linguists to propose that roots in Philippine-type languages are precategorial. That is to say, distinctions between nominal and verbal parts of speech are not made in the lexicon, instead the distinctions depend on the syntactic and morphological frames in which the roots are used. A summary of the arguments that have been made for and against a precategorial analysis of Philippine-type languages are presented in Section 6.3.1. The arguments are then applied to the Minangkabau case and it will be demonstrated that there is indeed evidence to support a categorisation of roots at the lexical level, and that the language is therefore not precategorial.\n6.3 Some Theoretical Solutions\n6.3.1 Precategoriality\nIn this section I will first discuss Foley’s (1998; 2008) proposal that Philippine-type languages are precategorial. I will then discuss some alternative solutions to the categoriality problem in Philippine-type languages presented by Kroeger (1998) and Himmelmann (2006a; 2008). I will then show some evidence to support the idea that Minangkabau is not precategorial.",

Nevertheless, syntactic and distributional evidence suggests that at least one of these ‘unnatural’ classes is false. In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class. However, this distinction is not captured by Chomsky’s (1970) classification framework.\n\n(22) a. John pounded the metal flat.\n\n(AP)\n\nb. John threw the ball into the barrel.

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

Ambo maagiahan inyo pitih.\n1sg AV-give-APP 3 money\n‘I gave that guy money.’ (Elicitation)\nAnother feature of ditransitive verbs is that the recipient argument can be assigned core argument status and swap places with the undergoer argument. For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

Minangkabau verb roots can be divided into two types: statives and actives (see Section 4.2.1.2). Active verb roots can further be divided into three types: active intransitives, transitives and ditransitives. Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4. The imperative construction will then be described in Section 4.3.2.5.\n\n87\n\n\f4.3.2.1 Stative Predicates\nBasic stative clauses have a stative verb as their head and a single undergoer argument which acts as the pivot and canonically precedes the verb. Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart. Example (75) illustrates a canonical, basic stative clause with the verb berang, ‘angry’. Please note that berang forms part of a special class of gradable stative verbs (see Section 4.2.1.2).\n\n(75)\n\nAmak berang.\n\nmum angry\n\n‘Mum is angry.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nSince berang is an emotion stative it has special syntactic valence. This means that a second argument can be added to this basic stative clause type with the addition of the preposition ka, as shown in (76).\n\n(76)\n\nAmak berang ka awak.\n\nmum angry to 1\n\n‘Mum was angry at me.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

                "content": "Chapter 5 describes the Minangkabau system of voice and verbal morphology. In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted. A similar construction also exists in Indonesian, which Chung (1976b) calls the “dative” construction (see Chapter 5).\nAlso compare the sentences in (100c) and (100d) to those in (98c) and (98d). Notice that the “dative” construction is ungrammatical in (98c) because the applicative -an does not appear on the verb whereas the applicative is not required in (100c). The fact that the applicative has a different role for these two verbs shows that semantic valence is specified by the Minangkabau verb root.\n4.3.2.5 Imperatives\nThe discussion in Section 4.3 has so far focused only on predicates in the indicative mood. This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan. Verbs in prohibitive constructions retain their voice marking.",

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively.

                "content": "Chapter 5 describes the Minangkabau system of voice and verbal morphology. In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

In this case, the syntactic frame can be described as a more general ‘predicate construction’ with a predicate (‘PRED’) as its head. The predicate construction is represented in (39) and described in further detail in Section 4.3.\n(39) Predicate Construction =\n((NP) → (negator) → (TAM) → (voice marking)-PRED-(applicative) → (adverb) → (NP))\nMinangkabau verbs also display many of the formal properties of verbs described by Anderson (1985). These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes. Table 10 lists each of these formal properties of verbs and describes how these properties are realised in Minangkabau.\n67\n\n\fTable 10.

Predicate constructions using each of these verb types are discussed in the sections that follow. For statives see Section 4.3.2.1, for active intransitives see Section 4.3.2.2, for transitive see Section 4.3.2.3, and for ditransitives see Section 4.3.2.4.

Stative predicates are not marked by verbal morphology and can be distinguished from other verb types because of their stative aktionsart.

Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4).

This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6).

First, the characterisation of voice relies heavily on the nature of grammatical relations in the language. Second, in addition to the syntactic processes that motivate voice, it is also essential to consider the motivating discourse/pragmatic factors involved. Third, as well as encoding syntactic distinctions, voice marking may also encode semantic and conceptual distinctions such as aspectual notions. This third issue is especially important to consider for pivotless languages like Acehnese, since ‘voice’ marking does not encode grammatical relations in this kind of language. These theoretical themes also heavily inform my characterisation of the syntactic, discourse/pragmatic, and semantic properties of voice in Minangkabau (see Chapter 5).\n40\n\n\f41",

Perhaps bare verb constructions don’t represent some kind of defective or underspecified version of a voice marked verb construction. Instead, they are used in cases where voice and semantic roles are not just underspecified, but unimportant.

Some Austronesian voice markers also have aspectual qualities which may be linked with their role in showing semantic and conceptual notions (cf. Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

                "content": "verb but also by the fact that babae, ‘woman’, is marked by the article ang, which denotes pivot status. The other participants in the clause are marked by articles that show their semantic role; for example the benefactor bata, ‘child’, is marked by the benefactive composite para sa and so on.\nSentences (5b), (5c) and (5d) show the three other Tagalog voice types. In (5b) the verb is marked for goal voice, meaning that the goal bigas, ‘rice’, is the pivot. In (5c) the direction is the pivot therefore the verb is marked for locative voice, and in (5d) the benefactor is pivot therefore the verb is marked for benefactive voice.\nAn additional typologically salient feature of Philippine-type voice systems is that they are symmetrical (Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2005; 2008). This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6).

Perhaps bare verb constructions don’t represent some kind of defective or underspecified version of a voice marked verb construction. Instead, they are used in cases where voice and semantic roles are not just underspecified, but unimportant.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b).

In the Malay/Indonesian di- passive construction, the actor is clearly demoted to non-core argument status, whereas the actor in a P2 clause remains a core argument of the verb (Arka and Manning, 2008; Cole, Hermon and Tjung, 2006).

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

Since the shift in verb marking does not entail any change to syntactic organisation or grammatical relations, Gil (2002a) concludes that they must encode a semantic or conceptual distinction. Indeed, if we look at the context for each of the utterances in (20) we find that in (20a) the actor, the boy taking leave, is more conceptually salient, whereas in (20b) it is the patient, the customer’s sandals, that is the conceptually salient participant. It is this conceptual shift in focus to the actor or patient that triggers the use of N- and di- respectively.\n\nSundic-type languages like Riau Indonesian also have a ‘neutral’ construction (see Table 5) in which the verb is unmarked for voice.

In (21a) notice that the verb is followed by the actor, the first person pronoun aku, and then the patient, laser, ‘ a laser’.

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate.

If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb. In (51c) the prefixation of the active voice marker maN- creates a change of state verb from the root word and in (51d) the addition of the applicative –an derives a transitive, causative verb.\n\n(51) a.\n\nBaju itame tu\n\nnan gaek-gaek tu.\n\nshirt black-3 DEM:dist REL RED-old DEM:dist\n\n‘The old people wear black shirts.’\n\n(Text ID: 445038115055260406)\n73",

In this example the comparative marker labiah, ‘more’, on pendek, ‘short’, is missing but the interpretation shorter is still available. The comparative reading relies on the presence of the prepositional phrase dari pisau tu.\n\n(80)\n\nPisau ko\n\npendek dari pisau tu.\n\nknife DEM:prox short\n\nfrom knife DEM:dist\n\n‘This knife is shorter than that one.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n89\n\n\fNon-gradable states do no co-occur with comparative markers because they represent inherent polar states. Example (81) illustrates the use of the non-gradable stative predicate mati, ‘dead’. Stative predicates, like all predicate constructions, can be modified by preceding TAM adverbials. In (81) the TAM adverbial alah is used to mark perfective aspect. It is inserted before the stative predicate mati, but after the undergoer, maliang tu, ‘the thief’.\n\n(81)\n\nMaliang tu\n\nalah mati.\n\nthief\n\nDEM:dist PFCT dead\n\n‘The thief died.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAnother feature of stative predicates is that they productively derive active transitive verbs with the addition of active voice morphology and the applicative -an. Most active transitive verbs derived from statives this way will have a causative meaning. In (82) the active transitive verb mandinginan, ‘to cause to be cold’, has been derived by adding the active voice prefix maN- and the applicative -an to the stative root dingin.\n\n(82)\n\nAmbo mandinginan gulai.\n\n1sg AV-cold-APP curry\n\n‘I’m cooling down the curry.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

This then allows for a distinction to be made between stative verbs, which are not gradable, and a special class of property words that are gradable (Steinhauer, 2008). In fact, property words crosslinguistically are comparative, i.e. gradable (Anderson, 1985; Croft, 1991; Dixon, 1982; Schachter, 1985), which stative verbs are not. In Minangkabau, property words are gradable too, as example (50) shows; the comparative prefix sa- on gadang, ‘big’, shows that gadang is gradable. According to Langacker’s (1987b) terminology, this\n9 Rumah Gadang translates literally as ‘big house’ but the term is actually used to refer to the distinctive Minangkabau traditional houses with pointed curved rooves intended to signify the horns of a water buffalo.\n72\n\n\fmeans that gadang is relational and therefore notionally an adjective. However, as we established in Section 4.1.2.1, stative verbs can also be construed as relational since their meaning is framed against a polar opposite.\n\n(50)\n\nBulek-bulek sagadang talua puyuah.\n\nRED-round COMP-big egg quail\n\n‘It is round and as big as a quail’s egg.’\n\n(Text ID: 217881132319230306)",

This means that a clausal complement (the cause) can be introduced into the clause with the use of a preposition. In (77) the cause of the fear, that the dog will bite, is marked by the causal marker dek.\n\n(77) a. b.\n\nInyo takuik.\n3 fear\n‘He’s scared.’\n\nDen takuik dek anjiang tu\n\nka manggigik den.\n\n1sg fear CAUSE dog\n\nDEM:dist FUT AV-bite\n\n1sg\n\n‘I’m scared that dog will bite me.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n88\n\n\fAs well as emotional states, Minangkabau stative clauses can also comprise inherent gradable physical states, for example pendek, ‘short’, tinggi, ‘tall’. Stative clauses with inherent physical state predicates have the same clause structure as emotional states but do not have the same special syntactic valence that allows for a second argument to be introduced into the clause. An example of a gradable stative predicate can be found in (78). The clause structure resembles the clause structure of a typical state as the undergoer pivot (the pronoun nyo) precedes the predicate tinggi, ‘tall’.\n\n(78)\n\nYo iko,\n\nnyo tinggi a.\n\nyes DEM:prox 3 tall FILL\n\n‘Yes this, its big eh.’\n\n(Text ID: 435063103250150406)\n\nGradable stative predicates can also be modified by comparative markers. In (79) the stative predicate tinggi is modified by the comparative labiah, ‘more’. Comparatives are inserted before the predicate and after any tense or aspect adverbials. Comparatives cannot be used with attributive nominal predicates like those exemplified in (58).\n\n(79)\n\nAnak tu\n\nalah labiah tinggi dari udanyo.\n\nchild DEM:dist PFCT more tall from older.brother-3\n\n‘That kid is already taller than his older brother.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

Stative clauses with inherent physical state predicates have the same clause structure as emotional states but do not have the same special syntactic valence that allows for a second argument to be introduced into the clause. An example of a gradable stative predicate can be found in (78).

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb. In (51c) the prefixation of the active voice marker maN- creates a change of state verb from the root word and in (51d) the addition of the applicative –an derives a transitive, causative verb.\n\n(51) a.\n\nBaju itame tu\n\nnan gaek-gaek tu.\n\nshirt black-3 DEM:dist REL RED-old DEM:dist\n\n‘The old people wear black shirts.’\n\n(Text ID: 445038115055260406)\n73",

Emotions are especially interesting cases because they have special syntactic valence (cf. Klamer, 2002: 941). In Indonesian, property words are intransitive. Property words denoting emotions are also syntactically intransitive but can be semantically transitive. This means that second arguments are required to be marked by a preposition. The Indonesian property word marah, ‘angry’, can have two participants: the core argument is the person who is angry, i.e. the undergoer, the second participant has the role of being either the recipient or the cause of the anger. The recipient or cause is not a core syntactic participant therefore they must be preceded by a preposition which denotes their relationship to the action, for example dengan, ‘with’, kepada, ‘to’, pada, ‘on’, terhadap, ‘regarding’, or akan, ‘about’. In Minangkabau, property words denoting emotions have similar special syntactic valence. For example, in (76) notice that awak, the recipient of the emotion, is marked by the preposition ka.\n\nIn Minangkabau, colours do not behave differently to other gradable property words. In (51) notice that the property word itam, ‘black’, occurs in constructions similar to those in (49) in which gadang, ‘big’, was the property word. In (51a) itam functions attributively to modify the noun phrase baju, ‘shirt’. In (51b) itam functions predicatively like a stative verb. In (51c) the prefixation of the active voice marker maN- creates a change of state verb from the root word and in (51d) the addition of the applicative –an derives a transitive, causative verb.\n\n(51) a.\n\nBaju itame tu\n\nnan gaek-gaek tu.\n\nshirt black-3 DEM:dist REL RED-old DEM:dist\n\n‘The old people wear black shirts.’\n\n(Text ID: 445038115055260406)\n73",

In this example the comparative marker labiah, ‘more’, on pendek, ‘short’, is missing but the interpretation shorter is still available. The comparative reading relies on the presence of the prepositional phrase dari pisau tu.\n\n(80)\n\nPisau ko\n\npendek dari pisau tu.\n\nknife DEM:prox short\n\nfrom knife DEM:dist\n\n‘This knife is shorter than that one.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\n89\n\n\fNon-gradable states do no co-occur with comparative markers because they represent inherent polar states. Example (81) illustrates the use of the non-gradable stative predicate mati, ‘dead’. Stative predicates, like all predicate constructions, can be modified by preceding TAM adverbials. In (81) the TAM adverbial alah is used to mark perfective aspect. It is inserted before the stative predicate mati, but after the undergoer, maliang tu, ‘the thief’.\n\n(81)\n\nMaliang tu\n\nalah mati.\n\nthief\n\nDEM:dist PFCT dead\n\n‘The thief died.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nAnother feature of stative predicates is that they productively derive active transitive verbs with the addition of active voice morphology and the applicative -an. Most active transitive verbs derived from statives this way will have a causative meaning. In (82) the active transitive verb mandinginan, ‘to cause to be cold’, has been derived by adding the active voice prefix maN- and the applicative -an to the stative root dingin.\n\n(82)\n\nAmbo mandinginan gulai.\n\n1sg AV-cold-APP curry\n\n‘I’m cooling down the curry.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

He further explains that the roots must take on nominal or verbal properties according to the construction in which they are used. He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

This then allows for a distinction to be made between stative verbs, which are not gradable, and a special class of property words that are gradable (Steinhauer, 2008). In fact, property words crosslinguistically are comparative, i.e. gradable (Anderson, 1985; Croft, 1991; Dixon, 1982; Schachter, 1985), which stative verbs are not. In Minangkabau, property words are gradable too, as example (50) shows; the comparative prefix sa- on gadang, ‘big’, shows that gadang is gradable. According to Langacker’s (1987b) terminology, this\n9 Rumah Gadang translates literally as ‘big house’ but the term is actually used to refer to the distinctive Minangkabau traditional houses with pointed curved rooves intended to signify the horns of a water buffalo.\n72\n\n\fmeans that gadang is relational and therefore notionally an adjective. However, as we established in Section 4.1.2.1, stative verbs can also be construed as relational since their meaning is framed against a polar opposite.\n\n(50)\n\nBulek-bulek sagadang talua puyuah.\n\nRED-round COMP-big egg quail\n\n‘It is round and as big as a quail’s egg.’\n\n(Text ID: 217881132319230306)",

However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4).

It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

                "content": "Chapter 5 describes the Minangkabau system of voice and verbal morphology. In order to appreciate the claims made in that chapter it is necessary to have a preliminary understanding of verbs and predication in the language. Section 4.2.1.2 described the formal properties of verbs in Minangkabau and showed the syntactic frame of the predicate construction (see example (39)). However, the features of the predicate construction in general, including non-prototypical predicate constructions, also need to be examined. It is towards this aim that the remainder of this chapter will examine this construction in detail. Non verbal predicate constructions are discussed in Section 4.3.1. These predicate types include nominal predicates (Section 4.3.1.1), numeral predicates (Section 4.3.1.2), existential predicates (Section 4.3.1.3) and locative predicates (Section 4.3.1.4). The details of verbal predicates are discussed in Section 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 Non-verbal Predicates\n\n4.3.1.1 Nominal Predicates\nClauses with nominal predicates have a noun phrase as their head. Clauses with nominal predicates are usually equative or identifying (Lyons, 1995); they construct the pivot NP as being the same as the NP that predicates. For example, in (57) the pivot NP namo anak tu, ‘that child’s name’, is equated with the noun phrase Ana.\n\n(57)\n\nNamo anak tu\n\nAna.\n\nname child DEM:dist Ana\n\n‘That child's name is Ana.’\n\n(Elicitation)\n\nNominal predicates can also function in a similar way to statives. For example, in (58) the predicate NP guru, ‘teacher’, is attributive. Also notice that in (58) the predicate is modified by the aspectual marker alah. All nominal predicates can be modified by TAM adverbials just as verbs are.\n\n82\n\n\f(58)\n\nInyo alah guru.\n\n3 PFCT teacher\n\n‘She is already a teacher.’\n\n(Elicitation)",

                "content": "verb but also by the fact that babae, ‘woman’, is marked by the article ang, which denotes pivot status. The other participants in the clause are marked by articles that show their semantic role; for example the benefactor bata, ‘child’, is marked by the benefactive composite para sa and so on.\nSentences (5b), (5c) and (5d) show the three other Tagalog voice types. In (5b) the verb is marked for goal voice, meaning that the goal bigas, ‘rice’, is the pivot. In (5c) the direction is the pivot therefore the verb is marked for locative voice, and in (5d) the benefactor is pivot therefore the verb is marked for benefactive voice.\nAn additional typologically salient feature of Philippine-type voice systems is that they are symmetrical (Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2005; 2008). This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6). Thus, voice marking in Philippine-type languages also has a verbal derivational function.\n2.2 Indonesian-type Voice",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf.

However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957).

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

These formal properties include the fact that verbs are marked for adverbial notions such as negation as well as tense, aspect and mood distinctions. Crosslinguistically verbs are also divided into classes based on their aktionsart properties or are divided into conjugation classes. According to Anderson’s (1985) schema, verbs also display formal properties based on their relational functions, i.e. licensing particular argument structures. These properties include showing valency, marking causative constructions, displaying voice marking, and showing reflexive and reciprocal processes.

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

The verb gigik, ‘bite’, in (154) is transitive and therefore specifies an undergoer argument but in this example the undergoer argument is omitted and the verb is not marked for active voice. This means that “the semantic transitivity of the verb root is not represented” thus causing the clause to be ungrammatical (Fortin, 2001: 14). Although Fortin’s claims may represent the judgments of many Minangkabau speakers, the conversational data in the MPI EVA Minangkabau database reveals a different picture.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

The reference related properties of subjects, such as the ability to be relativised and to launch floating quantifiers, correspond most closely to the function of the pivot, whereas the role related properties are performed by the actor participant, whether the actor is aligned with the pivot function or not (see below).\n\nFoley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) argue that voice in Philippine-type languages constitutes a realignment between the grammatical function of pivot and semantic role. This means that voice marking on the verb changes according to the semantic role of the participant that is selected to be the pivot. Philippine-type languages are conservative (when compared to Indonesian-type languages) and have rich voice systems that allow for a range of different participant types to be selected as pivot (Ross, 2002).\n\nTagalog is described as having four voices, as example (5) demonstrates.\n\n(5) a. b. c. d.\n\nMag-salis\n\nang babae ng bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nACT:TOP-will-take-out TOP woman GOAL rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘The woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisin\n\nng babae ang bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nGOAL:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman TOP rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take the rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisan\n\nng babae ng bigasang sako para.sa bata.\n\nDIR:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice TOP sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of the sack for a/the child.’\n\nIpag-salis\n\nng babae ng bigas sa sako ang bata.\n\nBENF:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice DIR sack TOP child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for the child.’",

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

According to Schachter (1976; 1977), in Philippine-type languages, there is a division of these role and reference related properties of subjects between the actor and the pivot. The reference related properties of subjects, such as the ability to be relativised and to launch floating quantifiers, correspond most closely to the function of the pivot, whereas the role related properties are performed by the actor participant, whether the actor is aligned with the pivot function or not (see below).\n\nFoley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) argue that voice in Philippine-type languages constitutes a realignment between the grammatical function of pivot and semantic role. This means that voice marking on the verb changes according to the semantic role of the participant that is selected to be the pivot. Philippine-type languages are conservative (when compared to Indonesian-type languages) and have rich voice systems that allow for a range of different participant types to be selected as pivot (Ross, 2002).\n\nTagalog is described as having four voices, as example (5) demonstrates.\n\n(5) a. b. c. d.\n\nMag-salis\n\nang babae ng bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nACT:TOP-will-take-out TOP woman GOAL rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘The woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisin\n\nng babae ang bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nGOAL:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman TOP rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take the rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisan\n\nng babae ng bigasang sako para.sa bata.\n\nDIR:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice TOP sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of the sack for a/the child.’\n\nIpag-salis\n\nng babae ng bigas sa sako ang bata.\n\nBENF:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice DIR sack TOP child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for the child.’",

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

Both transitive and intransitive bare active verbs were found in the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus, but intransitive verbs were found to be unmarked more frequently than transitives. Using the bare form of an active intransitive verb instead of the voice marked form is unambiguous because only one participant, the actor, is licensed by the verb. This means that assigning a semantic role to the participant is based on the inherent argument structure of the verb rather than syntactic or discourse-pragmatic factors.\nSome examples of bare active intransitive verbs follow in (249) and (250). In (249) the active intransitive verb lari, ‘run’, is not marked for voice yet the third person participant nyo is clearly an actor because this is the only participant role specified by the verb. Similarly in (250) the active intransitive verb tagak, ‘stand (up)’, is not marked for voice.

This results in a change in word order as the new core argument is moved to post verbal position.

Using the bare form of an active intransitive verb instead of the voice marked form is unambiguous because only one participant, the actor, is licensed by the verb. This means that assigning a semantic role to the participant is based on the inherent argument structure of the verb rather than syntactic or discourse-pragmatic factors.\nSome examples of bare active intransitive verbs follow in (249) and (250). In (249) the active intransitive verb lari, ‘run’, is not marked for voice yet the third person participant nyo is clearly an actor because this is the only participant role specified by the verb.

Discourse-pragmatic and contextual factors play a significant role in determining this. The syntactic organisation of the clause also affects the interpretation of bare verbs as active or passive since passive voice clauses are highly syntactised.\n6.1.2.1 Bare Actives\nLike Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf.

Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked.

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

For these predicates, I argue that ba- functions to mark middle voice. These middle predicates are intransitive but it is clear that the actor also undergoes some change, so in this sense they are broadly reflexive. Middle voice in Minangkabau resembles the middle voice of Greek which is used to mark transitive predicates that are somewhere between an active and a passive, or intransitive predicates that have a passive like relation to their subject (Bakker, 1994). In fact, the reflexive and reciprocal predicates can also be described as middle constructions since the action does not extend beyond the sphere of the actor. According to Croft’s (1991; 1994) event-based framework for voice phenomena, reflexives and reciprocals have the same event frame as middle verbs since they involve a situation in which the subject is both the initiator and end point of the action.\n\nCross-linguistically, the middle voice is associated with a number of situation types that involve similar aktionsart and event properties. Based on Talmy’s (1972) classification of event types, Kemmer (1994: 181-83) lists ten middle situation types that might involve middle marking in languages that have a middle voice.

Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another.

These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point. Thus voice marking encodes how the action originates “origin of action”, how the action progresses “development of action”, and how and where the action ends “termination of action” (Shibatani, 2006). For example, transitive actions typically end in the patient being affected, however in some events, the action terminates at a third entity, perhaps a recipient or a benefactor, thus the focus is on the end point of the action. If voice marking encodes this kind of situation type then it can be said to show the “termination of action”. Types of voice marking that fall into this category include benefactives, malefactives and applicatives (Shibatani, 2006: 240). Other types of voice marking used to encode distinctions at each point in the “evolution of action” are listed in Table 16.\n\nTable 16.

These conceptual phenomena include showing the pragmatic relevance of event participants but also how the event itself progresses, a concept that Shibatani refers to as the “evolution of action” (similar positions are also taken in Croft, 1994; Gil, 2002a; Kemmer, 1993). Shibatani (2006) argues that voice marking reflects human conceptualisations of events and that the “evolution of action” reflects the fact that humans understand different events to have a focus either on the event’s origins, its development, or its end point. Thus voice marking encodes how the action originates “origin of action”, how the action progresses “development of action”, and how and where the action ends “termination of action” (Shibatani, 2006). For example, transitive actions typically end in the patient being affected, however in some events, the action terminates at a third entity, perhaps a recipient or a benefactor, thus the focus is on the end point of the action. If voice marking encodes this kind of situation type then it can be said to show the “termination of action”. Types of voice marking that fall into this category include benefactives, malefactives and applicatives (Shibatani, 2006: 240). Other types of voice marking used to encode distinctions at each point in the “evolution of action” are listed in Table 16.\n\nTable 16.

For these predicates, I argue that ba- functions to mark middle voice. These middle predicates are intransitive but it is clear that the actor also undergoes some change, so in this sense they are broadly reflexive. Middle voice in Minangkabau resembles the middle voice of Greek which is used to mark transitive predicates that are somewhere between an active and a passive, or intransitive predicates that have a passive like relation to their subject (Bakker, 1994). In fact, the reflexive and reciprocal predicates can also be described as middle constructions since the action does not extend beyond the sphere of the actor. According to Croft’s (1991; 1994) event-based framework for voice phenomena, reflexives and reciprocals have the same event frame as middle verbs since they involve a situation in which the subject is both the initiator and end point of the action.\n\nCross-linguistically, the middle voice is associated with a number of situation types that involve similar aktionsart and event properties. Based on Talmy’s (1972) classification of event types, Kemmer (1994: 181-83) lists ten middle situation types that might involve middle marking in languages that have a middle voice. Kemmer’s middle situation types are listed in Table 19.\n\n164\n\n\fTable 19.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Like reflexive predicates, the verb root to which ba- affixes is transitive but an undergoer argument is not specified. This is because the actor is also understood to be the affectee of the action because of the way the ba- prefix shows how the action develops. Reciprocal rather than reflexive interpretations are available for examples (213) to (215) because the actors are plural and the verb roots encode naturally reciprocal events.\n\nIn (213) the reciprocal verb bacakak, ‘fight each other’, has been created from the transitive verb root cakak, ‘fight’, and in (214) the reciprocal form basukoan, ‘like each other’, comes from the verb root sukoan, ‘like (something)’.

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-.

These kind of adverbs represent two distinct closed classes: negation and TAM adverbs. Adverbial notions such as manner and intensity of action, on the other hand, represent an open class. Manner and intensity adverbs are also realised as distinct lexical items, except they come after the verb instead of preceding it.\n\nJust as nouns function across a range of functional domains, adverbial words denoting manner and intensity of action are also multifunctional as attributive devices. They can be used to modify not just verbs, but nominals and gradable stative verbs as well. Unmarked adverbs can also function to predicate.\n\nExample (55) illustrates the use of the manner adverb capek, ‘fast, quickly’. In (55a) capek functions prototypically as a verbal modifier. Notice that capek appears in the slot following the active intransitive verb lari. In (55b) we find capek modifying the same verb lari. However, in this example, lari is performing a referential role since the enclitic nyo refers to a possessor rather than an actor. This is evidence that words denoting adverbial notions can also function attributively to modify nominals. In (55c) we find another instance of capek performing a non-prototypical function. In this example capek functions predicatively. Evidence for this comes from the use of the imperative marker -lah.\n\n(55) a.\n\nInyo lari capek\n3 run fast\n‘She runs fast.’\n\n76",

In Colloquial Minangkabau the functional load of maN- is primarily semantic since it is not used to mark a pragmatic voice distinction (see Chapter 6).\n\nThere is also evidence to support an analysis of meN- in Malay/Indonesian as a semantic/conceptual device used to mark aspectual notions. Hopper’s (1979) work argues that the foregrounding and backgrounding of events in Classical Malay discourse is achieved through voice marking, whereas other languages achieve this through various other strategies including tense-aspect marking on the verb, word order, and\n131",

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication.

If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun].

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

The answer is that verbs can function referentially but that they are morphologically marked when\n\n74\n\n\fthey do so.

Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

What about languages like Malay/Indonesian whose class of so-called ‘adjectives’ behave more like stative verbs (Steinhauer, 2008)? The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model. First, there is some indeterminacy about the boundaries between nouns and verbs in Minangkabau. Second, there is also some indeterminacy about the nature of adjectives. Theories about parts of speech based on the prototype approach are able to account for the Minangkabau situation more convincingly. Two such theories are described in Sections 4.1.3.1 and 4.1.3.2. The first theory, promoted by Langacker (1987a; 1987b), defines parts of speech along conceptual grounds. The second, outlined in Croft (1990; 1991; 2000), bases categorisation of parts of speech on functional grounds.\n4.1.3.1 Langacker",

It is now necessary to establish the formal linguistic features of reference typologically and, more specifically, in Minangkabau. Andrews (1985) claims that there are three major factors involved in reference: semantics, pragmatics and syntax. By semantics, Andrews means the kind of meaning the noun has in a sentence, i.e. its semantic role. By pragmatics, Andrews is referring to the fact that the referents of nouns are inextricably linked with context; discourse-pragmatic contextual information determines what the speaker presumes is prior knowledge as well as the relative topicality status of the noun’s referent. The syntactic factors involved in reference are the relationships that the nouns have with the syntactic organisation of the clause because nouns encode grammatical relations.\nAs well as these general functional properties of nouns, there are specific morphological, syntactic and distributional formal properties of nouns that relate to their definitional referential role. Typological studies show that cross-linguistically nouns are marked for number, can be assigned class membership (for example gender), can have diminutive forms, and are marked for definiteness or deictic status. Since their syntactic function is to encode grammatical relations, nouns are also marked for case and argument type (Anderson, 1985).\nIn Minangkabau, nouns are those words which relate to Croft’s (1990; 1991; 2000) conceptual category of ‘object’ and which are prototypically used to refer (although nouns can also be used to predicate, see Section 4.3.1.1). Nouns in Minangkabau also show many of the formal properties associated with reference discussed by Anderson (1985), as shown in Table 9.\n59\n\n\fTable 9.

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

He further explains that the roots must take on nominal or verbal properties according to the construction in which they are used. He says, “even if a language has a single class of stems that function as either nouns or verbs, a stem nevertheless takes on the differentiating properties of one class or the other whenever it is employed in a particular construction” (Langacker, 1987a: 54).\n\nLangacker’s (1987b) conceptual analysis of parts of speech is summarised in Table 7. Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Chomsky’s (1970) feature classification system for parts of speech.\n\n[±NOUN] [±VERB]\n\nVERBS +\n\nNOUNS + -\n\nADJECTIVES + +\n\nADPOSITIONS -\n\nChomsky’s (1970) feature based classification system for parts of speech provided some useful first steps towards a thorough definition of lexical categories in universal terms. Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf.

The ‘accidental’ categories of inflection can be equated with grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case tense, aspect, and mood. The formal properties of grammatical category inflection can then be used to identify which part of speech category a word belongs to. Thus, according to Aristotelian theory, a noun refers to a substantive entity that exists in the real world whose ‘accidents’, such as person, number and case, are marked in a certain, consistent way (Lyons, 1968).\nThe use of formal criteria to establish parts of speech is useful in that it helps to avoid the inherent circularity of defining parts of speech on notional grounds. However, any formal definitions are unavoidably language specific. So in contrast to traditional theories about parts of speech, Generative Linguistics aims to make generalisations across a range of different languages and, in order to do this, assumes an underlying level of language structure in addition to language specific surface structure. Thus Generativists “define the parts of speech, not as classes of words in surface structure, but as deep structure constituents of sentences” (Lyons, 1968: 319).\n4.1.2 The Generative Classification of Parts of Speech\nMore specifically, the traditional Generative view is that parts of speech can be defined according to two ‘deep structure’ primitive features: [±noun] and [±verb] (Chomsky, 1970). For a language like English, Chomsky (1970) argued that there are four major parts of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adpositions which can be characterised in terms of these deep structure constituents. Verbs are [+verb] and [-noun], whereas nouns are [+noun] and [-verb]. Since adjectives display verbal like features, but are used to modify nouns, they are [+verb; +noun]. The fourth category, adpositions, are [-verb; -noun]. This classification system is presented in Table 6.\n50",

Nevertheless, there are a number of problems with his framework. One such problem is that the features themselves are not well defined. Croft (2000: 66) argues that since the features [±noun] and [±verb] are assumed to be universal operators there is no rigorous methodology available to establish exactly what semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties are associated with them. So we nevertheless end up with a circular definition about parts of speech; a verb is something that is [+verb] and a noun is something that is [+noun]; [+verb] describes verbal properties of parts of speech and [+noun] describes nominal properties of parts of speech. It is clear then that we need a comprehensive methodology to establish the precise features associated with each lexical class before we can characterise the similarities and differences between them.\n\nA further argument against Chomsky’s (1970) classification system arises from the fact that the natural classes the features suggest do not stand up to scrutiny. Baker (2003) reasons that the features [±noun] and [±verb] divide the four categories noun, verb, adjective and adposition, into natural classes. For example nouns and adjectives form a natural class because they are both [+noun].",

Some Austronesian voice markers also have aspectual qualities which may be linked with their role in showing semantic and conceptual notions (cf. Himmelmann, 2006a; Hopper, 1979; Rafferty, 1982; Soh and Nomoto, 2008; Son and Cole, 2008).\nThe discussion of Austronesian voice and verb morphology in this chapter aims to contextualise the study of Minangkabau presented in this dissertation as well as to provide a theoretical framework for examining voice phenomena in Minangkabau. It also aims to support my characterisation of Minangkabau as a language that possesses features of both a pragmatically motivated voice system and a voice system that is used to encode conceptual properties of events.\n2.1 Philippine-type Voice\nIn Philippine-type languages the discourse notion of ‘topic’ has been grammaticalised. This means that the most topical participant in a given utterance has control over morphological marking of the verb (i.e. the voice of the verb) as well as the syntactic organisation of the clause (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Schachter, 1976; 1977). Foley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) refer to the kind of grammatical function that the topic performs in Philippine-type language as the ‘pivot’. Their term ‘pivot’ also refers to the kind of grammatical function that the subject in English performs. The pivot is the participant that occupies the highest position in terms of grammatical relations. It dictates morphological ‘agreement’ or marking on the verb, as well having control over some elements of clausal syntax. The pivot is also highly referential and typically definite.",

Davies (2005: 213) found that in Madurese, foregrounding clauses were more likely to occur in passive voice, which he refers to as “object voice” and which is marked by the prefix e-. Backgrounding clauses, on the other hand, were more likely to occur in the active voice, which is marked by a\n29\n\n\fhomorganic nasal prefix N-.

Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf.

Since object words, property words and action words are all able to function to refer, modify and predicate in unmarked forms he argues that there are just two categories in these languages. There is a single category of open class items, consisting of object, property and action words, and a single category of closed class items, consisting of syntactic function words such as pragmatic particles, prepositions, TAM markers and conjunctions. There is also some indeterminacy about the classification of nouns and verbs in Philippine-type languages (cf. Donohue, 2008; Foley, 1998; Himmelmann, 2006a; 2008; Kaufman, 2007; Kroeger, 1998) (see Section 6.3.1).",

Nouns are non-relational because they refer to discrete entities whereas verbs and adjectives are relational. Verbs are used to predicate, which implies relationality between the participants and the event. Adjectives modify, therefore they have a relational function: connecting nouns with their properties. Gradable adjectives (for example, happy, big) are also relational in the sense that they specify the property of the noun at a certain point along a scale of comparison. Polar adjectives (for example, dead, pregnant) are relational in that they specify the property of the noun in relation to an opposite quality.\n\nTable 7.

According to Schachter (1976; 1977), in Philippine-type languages, there is a division of these role and reference related properties of subjects between the actor and the pivot. The reference related properties of subjects, such as the ability to be relativised and to launch floating quantifiers, correspond most closely to the function of the pivot, whereas the role related properties are performed by the actor participant, whether the actor is aligned with the pivot function or not (see below).\n\nFoley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) argue that voice in Philippine-type languages constitutes a realignment between the grammatical function of pivot and semantic role. This means that voice marking on the verb changes according to the semantic role of the participant that is selected to be the pivot. Philippine-type languages are conservative (when compared to Indonesian-type languages) and have rich voice systems that allow for a range of different participant types to be selected as pivot (Ross, 2002).\n\nTagalog is described as having four voices, as example (5) demonstrates.\n\n(5) a. b. c. d.\n\nMag-salis\n\nang babae ng bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nACT:TOP-will-take-out TOP woman GOAL rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘The woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisin\n\nng babae ang bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nGOAL:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman TOP rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take the rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisan\n\nng babae ng bigasang sako para.sa bata.\n\nDIR:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice TOP sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of the sack for a/the child.’\n\nIpag-salis\n\nng babae ng bigas sa sako ang bata.\n\nBENF:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice DIR sack TOP child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for the child.’",

According to Schachter (1976; 1977), in Philippine-type languages, there is a division of these role and reference related properties of subjects between the actor and the pivot. The reference related properties of subjects, such as the ability to be relativised and to launch floating quantifiers, correspond most closely to the function of the pivot, whereas the role related properties are performed by the actor participant, whether the actor is aligned with the pivot function or not (see below).\n\nFoley and Van Valin (1985; 1984) argue that voice in Philippine-type languages constitutes a realignment between the grammatical function of pivot and semantic role. This means that voice marking on the verb changes according to the semantic role of the participant that is selected to be the pivot. Philippine-type languages are conservative (when compared to Indonesian-type languages) and have rich voice systems that allow for a range of different participant types to be selected as pivot (Ross, 2002).\n\nTagalog is described as having four voices, as example (5) demonstrates.\n\n(5) a. b. c. d.\n\nMag-salis\n\nang babae ng bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nACT:TOP-will-take-out TOP woman GOAL rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘The woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisin\n\nng babae ang bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nGOAL:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman TOP rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take the rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisan\n\nng babae ng bigasang sako para.sa bata.\n\nDIR:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice TOP sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of the sack for a/the child.’\n\nIpag-salis\n\nng babae ng bigas sa sako ang bata.\n\nBENF:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice DIR sack TOP child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for the child.’",

There is also evidence to suggest that languages like Malay/Indonesian do not have an adjective-verb distinction (Steinhauer, 2008). The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech.

The indeterminacy involved in defining category membership in these languages cannot be captured or explained by the traditional Generative view espoused by Chomsky (1970). In an effort to rethink the traditional generative criteria for assigning category labels, typological studies of language have moved towards thinking about lexical categories as ‘prototypes’. The ‘prototype’ approach is described in Section 4.1.3.\n\n4.1.3 Prototypes\nTypological discoveries about the variety of parts of speech systems in different languages raises questions primarily about a binary approach to defining these parts of speech. If the Nootkan, Salishan and Polynesian languages are said to lack a noun-verb distinction (see above) then do we characterise these parts of speech as [+noun, +verb]\n52",

Minangkabau classifiers are not morphologically marked on the noun, instead they consist of a noun root modified by a preceding cardinal number. They are typically inserted before the noun root but may also appear after the noun. Classes are based on the size or shape of the object and the classifier words themselves are derived from nouns denoting a prototypical member of the class. For example, thin, stick or branch shaped things belong to the batang ‘tree’ class, animals belong to the ikua ‘tail’ class, small round objects belong to the incek ‘seed’ class, and large roundish or squarish objects belong to the buah ‘fruit’ class. Numerical classifiers are not obligatory and are used mainly in the context of counting.\n\nExamples (28) and (29) illustrate the use of two classifiers ikua and incek. In (28) ikua is the numerical classifier for lauak, ‘fish’. In (29) the classifier incek refers to the (seed-shaped) object that inyo, ‘he’, would like to buy.\n62\n\n\f(28)",

This means that no single voice is basic or ‘underlying’, nor can any voice be directly derived from another voice. Philippine-type voice systems are also symmetrical in the sense that voice marking does not encode a change in valency of the verb root (Ross, 2002). Foley (1998) argues that the symmetry of Philippine-type voice systems has a number of implications for how we ought to understand the grammar of Philippine-type languages. First, since no single voice type is basic, this implies that a verb’s argument structure is realised as a result of voice affixation and is therefore not specified in the lexicon. Second, since argument structure is not specified in the lexicon, then there can be no underlying lexical distinction made between nouns and verbs (see Chapter 6). Thus, voice marking in Philippine-type languages also has a verbal derivational function.\n2.2 Indonesian-type Voice",

The binary approach does not allow us to show that adjectives in Malay/Indonesian are ‘verbier’ than adjectives in English.\nTo resolve this kind of problem, we can instead think about parts of speech as prototypes (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000; Gil, 2000; Langacker, 1987a; 1987b). According to prototype theory, lexical categories are defined in terms of the semantic, morphological, syntactic and distributional properties they possess as well as the conceptual domains in which they operate. Evidence based on typological tendencies as well as general cognitive principles is used to establish these semantic, morphological, syntactic, distributional and conceptual parameters. Prototypical members of parts of speech categories display all of these typical features. According to this theory, the prototypes are universal whereas language specific parts of speech categories fall somewhere within the domain of the prototypical categories.\nThere are two facts about Minangkabau parts of speech that are inadequately described by the Generative model.

If a clause satisfies more conditions of low transitivity than high transitivity, then that clause will be seen as being low in discourse transitivity. Even if a clause has only one participant, it can satisfy more transitivity conditions than a clause with two participants if the conditions B to H are high in transitivity (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 254). The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity. Clauses with N- marked verbs were irrealis, stative, off the timeline of the main narrative events, and more likely to have non-referential patients. Clauses with di- marked verbs, on the other hand, were\n26\n\n\findicative, eventive, and on the timeline of the main narrative events. These clauses were also more likely to have referential patients that were individuated, animate, and that had continuous mention throughout the text (Wouk, 1989: 132-40).",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Furthermore, the pervasive use of bare verbs in Colloquial Minangkabau has meant that the P2 is not a distinctive construction (see Section 6.1.2.4).\nThe following sections will show some examples of bare verbs found in the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus and discuss some of the ways in which speakers are able to decode the ‘voice’ of the bare verb forms and assign semantic roles to the participants in the clause. Discourse-pragmatic and contextual factors play a significant role in determining this. The syntactic organisation of the clause also affects the interpretation of bare verbs as active or passive since passive voice clauses are highly syntactised.\n6.1.2.1 Bare Actives\nLike Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b), bare verbs are frequently used in place of verbs marked for active voice. Both transitive and intransitive bare active verbs were found in the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus, but intransitive verbs were found to be unmarked more frequently than transitives. Using the bare form of an active intransitive verb instead of the voice marked form is unambiguous because only one participant, the actor, is licensed by the verb. This means that assigning a semantic role to the participant is based on the inherent argument structure of the verb rather than syntactic or discourse-pragmatic factors.\nSome examples of bare active intransitive verbs follow in (249) and (250). In (249) the active intransitive verb lari, ‘run’, is not marked for voice yet the third person participant nyo is clearly an actor because this is the only participant role specified by the verb. Similarly in (250) the active intransitive verb tagak, ‘stand (up)’, is not marked for voice. The first person plural pronoun kami is assigned the actor role because it is the only role specified by the verb.\n187\n\n\f(249) (250)",

The Transitivity Hypothesis then predicts that if two clauses show a difference in transitivity (i.e. one is high in discourse transitivity whereas the other is low in discourse transitivity) and that if one clause is grammatically marked in some way, then the difference in transitivity will be encoded by that marked grammatical construction (Hopper and Thompson, 1980: 255).\n\nIn Wouk’s (1989; 1996; 2004a) study of SJI, she found that verbs marked by the active voice marker N- were more frequently found in clauses that were low in discourse transitivity whereas verbs marked by the passive voice marker di- were more frequently found in clauses that were high in transitivity. Clauses with N- marked verbs were irrealis, stative, off the timeline of the main narrative events, and more likely to have non-referential patients. Clauses with di- marked verbs, on the other hand, were\n26\n\n\findicative, eventive, and on the timeline of the main narrative events. These clauses were also more likely to have referential patients that were individuated, animate, and that had continuous mention throughout the text (Wouk, 1989: 132-40).",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Furthermore, the pervasive use of bare verbs in Colloquial Minangkabau has meant that the P2 is not a distinctive construction (see Section 6.1.2.4).\nThe following sections will show some examples of bare verbs found in the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus and discuss some of the ways in which speakers are able to decode the ‘voice’ of the bare verb forms and assign semantic roles to the participants in the clause. Discourse-pragmatic and contextual factors play a significant role in determining this. The syntactic organisation of the clause also affects the interpretation of bare verbs as active or passive since passive voice clauses are highly syntactised.\n6.1.2.1 Bare Actives\nLike Spoken Jakarta Indonesian (cf. Wouk, 1989; 2004b), bare verbs are frequently used in place of verbs marked for active voice. Both transitive and intransitive bare active verbs were found in the MPI EVA Minangkabau corpus, but intransitive verbs were found to be unmarked more frequently than transitives. Using the bare form of an active intransitive verb instead of the voice marked form is unambiguous because only one participant, the actor, is licensed by the verb. This means that assigning a semantic role to the participant is based on the inherent argument structure of the verb rather than syntactic or discourse-pragmatic factors.\nSome examples of bare active intransitive verbs follow in (249) and (250). In (249) the active intransitive verb lari, ‘run’, is not marked for voice yet the third person participant nyo is clearly an actor because this is the only participant role specified by the verb. Similarly in (250) the active intransitive verb tagak, ‘stand (up)’, is not marked for voice.

In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Notice that the verb is marked by both the proclitic ji, which is co-referential with the (null) agent, and the enclitic geuh, which is coreferential with the undergoer, gopnyan, ‘he’. In Acehnese transitive verbs, the agents are compulsorily referenced by proclitics whereas undergoers are only optionally referenced by enclitics. The presence of undergoer enclitics implies that the undergoer is topical therefore it is rare to have a undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is topical (Durie, 1985a: 201-06).

However, he argues that the aspectual distinctions are a result of some clauses being foregrounding, i.e. they are central to the development of the narrative and are perfective, and some clauses being backgrounding, i.e. they provide information that supports, but is not central to, the main events of the narrative and are imperfective. He found that in Early Modern Malay the voice markers meN- and di-, which are cognate with Standard Indonesian meN- and di-, as well as Chindo N- and di-, are associated with backgrounding and foregrounding clauses respectively and the aspectual properties of these clauses are a ‘by-product’ of the voice markers. That is to say, that perfectivity and imperfectivity are not encoded by the voice markers, rather these aspectual notions are associated with the voice markers due to their propensity to appear in either foregrounding or backgrounding clauses.",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Notice that the verb is marked by both the proclitic ji, which is co-referential with the (null) agent, and the enclitic geuh, which is coreferential with the undergoer, gopnyan, ‘he’. In Acehnese transitive verbs, the agents are compulsorily referenced by proclitics whereas undergoers are only optionally referenced by enclitics. The presence of undergoer enclitics implies that the undergoer is topical therefore it is rare to have a undergoer cross-referencing on the verb if the agent is topical (Durie, 1985a: 201-06). In example (15) the undergoer is indeed topical since the agent is not overtly expressed. Notice also that the undergoer appears before the verb. The ability to appear in pre-verbal position is a property of Core Topics in Acehnese (see below).\n\nSince both active and stative verbs can be either agent oriented or undergoer oriented, Durie (1985a) argues that the split between agent oriented verbs and undergoer oriented verbs is instead defined according to the semantic notions of control and de-control. If a verb takes an agent, the ultimate initiator of the event, it is a controlled verb, whereas if a verb takes an undergoer, the participant that is ultimately affected by the event, then it is a de-controlled verb (Durie, 1985a: 55-56). Table 4 shows some examples of agent oriented (i.e. controlled) verbs and undergoer oriented (i.e. de-controlled) verbs. Notice that both the controlled and de-controlled categories include verbs which are semantically active and verbs which are semantically stative.\n\n32\n\n\fTable 4.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

Philippine-type languages are conservative (when compared to Indonesian-type languages) and have rich voice systems that allow for a range of different participant types to be selected as pivot (Ross, 2002).\n\nTagalog is described as having four voices, as example (5) demonstrates.\n\n(5) a. b. c. d.\n\nMag-salis\n\nang babae ng bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nACT:TOP-will-take-out TOP woman GOAL rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘The woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisin\n\nng babae ang bigas sa sako para.sa bata.\n\nGOAL:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman TOP rice DIR sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take the rice out of a/the sack for a/the child.’\n\nAalisan\n\nng babae ng bigasang sako para.sa bata.\n\nDIR:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice TOP sack BENF child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of the sack for a/the child.’\n\nIpag-salis\n\nng babae ng bigas sa sako ang bata.\n\nBENF:TOP-will-take-out ACT woman GOAL rice DIR sack TOP child\n\n‘A/the woman will take some rice out of a/the sack for the child.’",

In fact, adjectives and prepositions form a natural class in English because they can occur in constructions in which nouns and verbs cannot. To demonstrate this, Baker (2003: 2) argues that both adjectives and prepositions can appear clause finally in English transitive constructions showing the goal or result of an\n51\n\n\faction, whereas nouns and verbs cannot. The examples Baker cites are repeated here in (22). Notice that the goal or result of the action can be encoded by an adjective in (22a) and a preposition in (22b). Examples (22c) and (22d) show that nouns and verbs are ungrammatical in this position. Baker’s (2003) distributional evidence demonstrates that adjectives and prepositions form a natural class.

This is because the addressee is in ‘control’ over the act of remembering. However, in (18b) the act of remembering has been de-controlled due to the addition of the teu- prefix on the verb. Notice also that the de-controlled verb in (18b) is now undergoer oriented and is therefore marked by an undergoer enclitic, geuh, which is co-referential with the undergoer gopnyan (Durie, 1985b: 49).\n\nThe pronominal proclitic marking on Acehnese verbs is remarkable, not just because of the semantic distinctions about control and de-control that it entails, but because it does not encode grammatical relations or a voice distinction in the way that verbal marking does in Philippine and Indonesian-type languages. Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

For example, in (100c) and (100d) notice that the recipient urang tu, ‘that guy’, has been moved to core argument position following the verb. Its prepositional marker ka has also been deleted.

This section provides an overview of Minangkabau imperatives in order to complete our understanding of the predicate construction.\nIn Minangkabau, only verbal predicates can be used in the imperative construction. This suggests that predication is indeed the prototypical function of verbs in Minangkabau and that other parts of speech are not able to predicate in as complete a way as verbs. The imperative construction is marked on a bare verb root by -lah, the imperative postclitic11. If applicatives are required in the indicative form of the verb then these are retained in the imperative form. Prohibitives are formed by marking the verb with the prohibitive particle jan.

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’.

Acehnese is a pivotless language, which means that no one argument has a more privileged syntactic status than another. Agents and undergoers have control over various different constructions, for example only agents can be the addressees of imperatives, but this is based on the semantic qualities of the two argument types rather than any syntactic differences. Syntactic tests used to identify pivots also prove unsuccessful in Acehnese since the language has “no switch reference marking; any argument can be ellipsed in context; there is no syntactic passive or anti-passive to promote or demote arguments to or from a privileged syntactic status; there are no raising phenomena [...]; both agents and undergoers can be relativised in the same way; [and] there are no syntactic dummies” (Durie, 1985a: 190).",

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun.

Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo.

This is true also of Minangkabau, since similar ‘NP + NP[modifier]’ constructions are used to show relationships between nouns other than possession. For example, in (32) the NP manian anak tu could be construed not just as a possessive construction but also as an attributive construction, i.e. the NP could be just as easily translated as ‘a toy for children’ rather than ‘the child’s toy’. The exact nature of modification intended will be determined by context. Similarly in (33) the noun pakaian-pakaian, ‘clothes’, is modified by the nominal adat, ‘tradition’. Adat shows an attributive relationship to the noun pakaian-pakaian rather than a possessive one. Nouns can also be modified by verbs and relative clauses that occupy the same slot as attributive NPs (see (36)).\n\n(33)\n\nPakaian-pakaian adat.\n\nRED-wear-NOM tradition\n\n‘Traditional clothes.’\n\n(Text ID: 212694092757020606)\n\nMinangkabau nouns can also be marked by the specifiers iko or ko and itu or tu, which are proximal and distal demonstratives respectively.

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

In Minangkabau, possession is not morphologically marked on the noun. Instead, the verb punyo, ‘have’, is used to show a possessive relationship between the possessor and the possessed (see example (30)). Nouns can also be modified for possession by a following noun or pronoun. For example in (31), the noun abuak, ‘hair’, is marked for possession by the enclitic third person pronoun nyo.

He argues that we conceptualise the world primarily in terms of objects, properties and actions and that these categories perform three central functions: to show reference, modification and predication. According to Croft, the prototypical function of objects is to refer, the prototypical function of properties is to modify and the prototypical function of actions is to predicate. When performing their prototypical functions objects, properties and actions are realised in a given language as unmarked nouns, adjectives and verbs respectively.\nHowever, language specific instantiations of these parts of speech may differ from their prototypical instantiations. If this is the case, Croft (1990; 1991; 2000) argues that the non-prototypical instantiation of a word will show structural markedness in the form of derivational morphology, prepositional marking or some other kind of distinct syntactic marking. To illustrate this point, consider the word child. Child is an object and therefore its prototypical function is a referential one. This means that when functioning within its prototypical functional domain it will be realised as an unmarked noun. However, if the same concept is used to modify or predicate then it becomes structurally marked. For example, when used to modify child becomes childish, and when used to predicate child becomes be a child.",

Pronominal proclitics are always co-referential with the agent argument whereas pronominal enclitics are always co-referential with the undergoer argument. In Acehnese, grammatical relations are not affected by the split between intransitive and transitive clause types, instead they depend on this distinction between the roles of agent and undergoer. Thus both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in the same way depending on whether they are agent oriented or undergoer oriented (Durie, 1985a).\n\nSome Acehnese examples that demonstrate this pronominal clitic cross-referencing can be found in (13), (14) and (15).\n\n(13)\n\nLôn teungöh=lôn=jak.\n\nI middle=1=go\n\n‘I am going/walking.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 55)\n\n(14)\n\nGopnyan galak=geuh that.\n\nhe\n\nhappy=3\n\nvery\n\n‘He is very happy.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 56)\n\n31\n\n\f(15)\n\nGopnyan ka=ji=poh=geuh.\n\nhe\n\nIN=3=hit=3\n\n‘[He] hit him.’\n\n(Durie, 1985a: 203)\n\nExample (13) shows a clause with an intransitive, agent oriented verb jak, ‘go’. In this example, the first person pronoun lôn is the agent, therefore the verb is marked by the first person agent proclitic lôn. Example (14), on the other hand shows an example of an intransitive, undergoer oriented verb galak, ‘happy’. Since the undergoer gopnyan, ‘he’, is in the third person, the verb is thus marked by the third person undergoer enclitic geuh.",

More specifically, the involuntary marker ta- encodes the origin of the action and marks the fact that the action originates spontaneously (see Section 5.2.1), the causative prefix pa- also encodes the origin of the action except to show that the action is instigated by causal mechanisms (see Section 5.2.2), whereas the multifunctional affix ba- shows the development of the action (see Section 5.2.3).\n\nThe active voice prefix maN- also functions as part of this class of lexical/derivational affixes, to show the development of the action, since it has a role in encoding active aktionsart (see Section 5.1.2.3). The applicatives -an and -i, although functioning primarily in the syntactic domain as valency changing devices, also function as part of Minangkabau’s conceptually motivated voice system to show the termination of the action (see Section 5.3). The passive voice marker di- does not belong in this class because its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic. Its status as a morphosyntactic clitic also supports this analysis.\n\n5.2.1 Involuntary ta-\nThe Minangkabau involuntary marker ta- is a reflex of the Proto Malayic affix *tAr(Adelaar, 1992a: 154) and is cognate with the Malay/Indonesian affix ter-. The prefix is used to show an involuntary or spontaneous origin to events in opposition to causatives and passives where a volitional agent is implied. Ta- does not co-occur with any of the other Minangkabau verbal prefixes. However, there is at least one ta- verb that requires the applicative -an to license the correct argument structure: the verb tamandian, ‘to accidentally bathe someone’ (see example (188)).\n\n(188)",

This framework is useful for the linguist who has to account for indeterminacy of category membership. In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6). So instead of assigning each of these categories an inherent function in Minangkabau, we can instead assign category membership according to the construction specific properties of the word.\nThe prerogative to assign category membership according to the functional role of a word within a particular construction then raises questions about the nature of categorisation in the lexicon. Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function.

In Minangkabau, for instance, object words and property words can function to predicate, but remain unmarked. Bare verbs can also operate across a range of functional domains (see Chapter 6).

Croft (2000: 97) argues that the more marked the word is when functioning in a non-prototypical constructions, the more inherent the prototypical function of the word. The less marked the word then the less inherent is its prototypical function. Furthermore, the more categories an uninflected root can belong to, the more ‘precategorial’ the root is (Lehmann, to appear).\n\n57",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

In fact, in Minangkabau there is a distinction between stative verbs and activity verbs7. Stative verbs are unmarked by verbal morphology whereas activity verbs are marked by the active voice prefix maN- (see Section 4.3.2)8. Since the morphological and semantic properties of Minangkabau ‘property words’ (i.e. those NP modifiers that express the adjectival concepts of dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value, and speed (cf. Dixon, 1982; 2006)) resemble those of stative verbs, property words also form a part of Minangkabau’s class of stative verbs.\n\nInterestingly, in Malay/Indonesian there is some indeterminacy about the status of property words or adjectives as a class distinct from verbs because of their aktionsart properties (cf. Gil, 2000; Steinhauer, 2008). In terms of their prototypical function, adjectives are quite distinct from verbs because they are used to modify rather than predicate (Croft, 1990; 1991; 2000). However, cross-linguistically it seems that adjectives are a special kind of ‘state’ because their inherent time schemata is stative, i.e. they involve no change over time (Langacker, 1987b; Vendler, 1957). In Malay/Indonesian adjectives resemble stative verbs because they are used to predicate and their interaction with verbal morphology is the same as for stative verbs.",

More specifically, the involuntary marker ta- encodes the origin of the action and marks the fact that the action originates spontaneously (see Section 5.2.1), the causative prefix pa- also encodes the origin of the action except to show that the action is instigated by causal mechanisms (see Section 5.2.2), whereas the multifunctional affix ba- shows the development of the action (see Section 5.2.3).\n\nThe active voice prefix maN- also functions as part of this class of lexical/derivational affixes, to show the development of the action, since it has a role in encoding active aktionsart (see Section 5.1.2.3). The applicatives -an and -i, although functioning primarily in the syntactic domain as valency changing devices, also function as part of Minangkabau’s conceptually motivated voice system to show the termination of the action (see Section 5.3). The passive voice marker di- does not belong in this class because its functions are primarily syntactic and pragmatic. Its status as a morphosyntactic clitic also supports this analysis.\n\n5.2.1 Involuntary ta-\nThe Minangkabau involuntary marker ta- is a reflex of the Proto Malayic affix *tAr(Adelaar, 1992a: 154) and is cognate with the Malay/Indonesian affix ter-. The prefix is used to show an involuntary or spontaneous origin to events in opposition to causatives and passives where a volitional agent is implied. Ta- does not co-occur with any of the other Minangkabau verbal prefixes. However, there is at least one ta- verb that requires the applicative -an to license the correct argument structure: the verb tamandian, ‘to accidentally bathe someone’ (see example (188)).\n\n(188)",

These findings raise questions about the obligatoriness of the maN- prefix (see Chapter 6) and require us to rigorously assess the nature of argument structure in Minangkabau.\n\nThompson and Hopper’s (2001) study of argument structure in English examined a corpus of naturalistic conversational data. Their study revealed that speakers’ intuitions and linguists’ introspections about argument structure in English differ radically from the patterns revealed in their conversational data. One of their most significant findings is that verbs traditionally ascribed to the transitive category are frequently rendered intransitive in discourse. They also “identified both a range of uses and collocations of verbs as well as frequency effects that have not been addressed in argument structure discussions based on introspection” (Thompson and Hopper, 2001: 41). These findings indicate the importance of using naturalistic data, rather than elicited data or introspection, in order to paint an accurate picture of the variety of structures used in a language. If we see grammar as a reflection of how people use language then their study also reveals that in order to know all of the possible grammatical structures in a language then we must empirically examine the kinds of structures people use.",

A non-core argument, on the other hand, is “peripheral” in the sense that it is not as syntactically ‘available’ as a core argument. Non-core arguments are typically adjunct-like and their non-core status is often marked by the presence of adpositions (Arka, 2003b).\n\nSo, in contrast to the symmetric passive construction, in Standard Indonesian’s asymmetric passive, the actor argument is syntactically demoted and given non-core status (Arka, 2003b; Cole, Hermon and Yanti, 2007). This is marked by the presence of the agentive/causal preposition oleh. An example of this can be seen in (6c) where the actor Sul has been given non-core status and is thus preceded by the preposition oleh.\n\nHowever, in the pasif semu, also referred to as the ‘pseudo passive’, the object voice, or passive type two (hereafter the P2 construction), both actor and undergoer are retained as core arguments (Arka and Manning, 2008; Musgrave, 2000). In the P2 construction, the undergoer is selected as the pivot (cf. Chung, 1976a) and precedes the verb. The P2 verb is not marked for voice but hosts a pronominal proclitic coding the actor. The sentence in (7) shows an example of a P2 construction. In this example notice that the undergoer buku ini, ‘this book’, is the pivot and thus precedes the verb, baca, ‘read’. The first person actor, ku, then appears as a proclitic on the verb.\n\n(7)\n\nBuku ini\n\nsudah ku=baca.\n\nbook DEM:prox PFCT 1sg=read\n\n‘I have read this book.’\n\n(adapted from Sneddon, 1996: 249)",
