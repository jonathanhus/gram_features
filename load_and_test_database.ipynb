A detailed description of demonstratives is found in Chapter .\\nAdnominal demonstratives fill the last slot in the NP. The following examples show the demonstratives in adnominal function.

Note that locative and lative forms of the demonstratives contain the phonemes -t and -n, which are likely remnants of now defunct morphology. To increase readability of the glosses, and because these forms are very frequent, the locative wa-t=ko and me-t=ko and lative wa-n=ka and me-n=ka are given as their surface forms watko, metko, wangga and mengga.

Regular verbs can take mood enclitics, negator =nin and predicate linker =i directly on the root. Irregular verbs have a variable root ending in a vowel, -n or -t.

Table compares inflection of a regular verb with that of an irregular verb.\\nBehaviour of a regular and irregular verb under inflection\\nAlthough some syntactic and semantic tendencies can be identified (static intransitive verbs and Malay loans tend to be regular; many 'cut' verbs and all directional verbs are irregular), both groups contain verbs of all valencies and with all kinds of meanings. Verbs are not inflected for person or number, with the exception of plural imperative and a distributive suffix.person marking\\nThere are two processes of verb derivation: noun-to-verb derivation by reduplicationreduplication!verbs, and noun incorporation.

      "In (270a), berang, ‘angry’, is functioning predicatively as a stative verb and is therefore obligatorily unmarked. In (270b) notice that berang remains morphologically unmarked even though it is performing a referential function. In (270b) berang-berang becomes the undergoer argument of the verb tambah, ‘add, increase’. Sentence (270c) shows the use of the ‘tambah + NP’ construction with a nominal urang duo, ‘two people’, for comparison with the sentence in (270b). Notice that both sentences have the same word order despite the fact that the roots berang and urang duo come from different parts of speech categories.\n",
