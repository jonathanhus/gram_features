Sometimes these notions of specificity and definiteness are summed up in the term 'identifiability'.

As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum, making it hard to define discrete categories, but to qualify as an article a marker should be used in some cases to express definiteness without also expressing a spatial deictic meaning.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

That really hurts!'\\n\\nSentences will now be discussed in the following chapter.\\n\\n\\x0c134 Notes 1. Reduplication has been discussed in chapter four.\\n\\n\\x0c135\\nCHAPTER V I\\nTHE SENTENCE\\nFor purposes of this dissertation a sentence w ill be defined as a syntactic unit which consists of at least one independent clause and optionally one or more dependent clauses. The clauses may be combined in a number o f ways using various morphological devices. Optional final particles mark the end o f a sentence.\\nIn many Tibeto-Bunnan languages such as Tibetan it is quite common to have a string o f clauses where only the verb in the la st clause is finite and inflected (see DeLancey 1991). Mizo, however, does not allow for clause chains. The rest o f this chapter will describe the various clause combining strategies.\\nBasic Sentence Structure\\nAn independent clause consists minimally of an inflected independent verb stem. A dependent clause, on the other hand, may consist of a dependent verb stem or an uninflected independent verb stem. The arguments of the clause (subjects and objects) may not always be present Peripherals such as locatives, temporals, adverbials, etc. are optional elements o f a clause.\\nErgativity\\nSubjects of transitive verbs are always marked with the ergative suffix -in regardless o f their semantic role. The verb agreem ent system, however, does not distinguish between subjects of transitives and subjects of intransitives.\\n\\n\\x0c136\\n\\n(1) a. ka-ndu-in\\n\\na-kow-ce\\n\\n1Poss-mother-ERG 3s-call-2o\\n\\n'My mother is calling you.'\\n\\nb. voksa-thaaw-in mi-q^y pork-fat-ERG lo-hate 'Lard nauseates me.'\\n\\nc. ka-naaw a-fap lPoss-baby 3s-ciy 'My baby is crying.'\\n\\nErgadvity serves as a useful tool for identifying subjects o f clauses in a complex\\n\\nconstruction. For instance, in vert) serialization the ergative case marker on the subject\\n\\nshows that agreement is with the transtive verb, the first verb in the series. Ergativity is\")"

These categories are useful in helping distinguishing nouns from verbs as the distinction is not always clear when dealing with complex clauses. This chapter will discuss the morphological categories pertaining to noun phrases.\\nCase marking will be dealt w ith first, followed by a discussion o f pronominal paradigms. Noun modifiers and quantifiers follow n ex t The last section illustrates lexical nominalization.\\n\\nCase Marking\\n\\nIn a simple declarative clause the case markers are: -in ergative, -m instrumental/adverbial and -a? locative. Absolutives are unmarked. Genitives are marked\\n\\nby high tone and vocative by a low tone. The following examples are illustrative.\\n\\n( l) a . keel-in nhim a-pet goat-ERG grass 3s-graze 'A/the goat is eating/grazing grass.'\\n\\nb. khool-m-\\n\\npuin ka-thfly\\n\\nmachine-INSTR cloth ls-sew\\n\\n'I am sewing with a machine.'\\n\\nc. kdn-huan-a?\\n\\nkeel a-lhht\\n\\nls.pl-garden-LOC goat 3s-enter\\n\\n'A/the goat entered our garden.'\\n\\n\\x0cErgative\\n\\nLike many languages of this area, Mizo is an ergative language. The ergative\\n\\nsuffix -in marks all transitive subjects, regardless of their semantic role.\\n\\n(2) a. ka-nbu-m\\n\\nmin-vua\\n\\nlPoss-mother-ERG lo-beat\\n\\n'My mother beat me.'\\n\\nb. ka-nhit\\n\\nle? ka-p^a-in\\n\\nmfn-vua\\n\\nlPoss-m otherand lPoss-father-ERG lo-beat\\n\\n'My m other and my father beat me.'\\n\\nc. ka-p&a-in\\n\\nloom=man a-doq\\n\\nlPoss-father-ERG prize\\n\\n3s-receive\\n\\n'My father received a prize.'\\n\\nInstrumental/Adverbial\\n\\nThe instrumental case marker is -in. It also functions as an adverbializer.\\n\\n(3) a. Kim-&n\\n\\ntiaq-in\\n\\nmfn-vua\\n\\nKim-MASC.ERG stick-INSTR lo-beat\\n\\nTGma hit me with a stick.'\\n\\nb.

Furthermore,\\n\\nthe two clauses cannot share arguments.\\n\\nType 1.1: Finite Complements with no Complementizers\\n\\nUtterance predicates fall into this category. The CTP is normally the verb tii 'to do' which is used as the quotative 'say' in th is case. The complement, which is the reported speech, does not have any morphological markings and it has a finite verb. There is no restriction on tense and sped marking or negation within the complement clause itself.\\nThis is the only complement type where there is no overt indicator of subordination-the complement is not a reduced clause and there is no complementizer. W hen the complement clause is also transitive the subjects ofboth clauses are marked ergative thus showing that there are two subjects. In the examples below the verb agreement affixes show that the matrix and complement clauses have different subjects.\\n\\nI-fcRG [you-pl 2s.pI-go-FUT\\n\\niy/do\\n\\n1 said you all will go.’\\n\\nb. k< I-\\n\\nil-lo w -d n nag-nil in-kal-low-dn\\nyou-PL 2s.p.pl-l-ggoo--NNtEGG-F-FUUTT\\n\\n1J klsa--staiiy /d o\\n\\n1 said you all will not go.'\\n\\n\\x0c168\\n\\nc.
